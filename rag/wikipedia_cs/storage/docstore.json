"metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Title: Data science\r\nData science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data. \r\nData science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine). Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.\r\nData science is \"a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods\" to \"understand and analyze actual phenomena\" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that \"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\" and the data deluge.\r\nA data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to summarize data.\r\n\r\nFoundations\r\nData science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from typically large data sets and applying the knowledge from that data to solve problems in other application domains. The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data, and summarizing these findings. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, data visualization, graphic design, communication, and business.\r\nVasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from images, text, sensors, transactions, customer information, etc.) and emphasizes prediction and action. Andrew Gelman of Columbia University has described statistics as a non-essential part of data science. Stanford professor David Donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.\r\n\r\nEtymology\r\nEarly usage\r\nIn 1962, John Tukey described a field he called \"data analysis\", which resembles modern data science. In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, C. F. Jeff Wu used the term \"data science\" for the first time as an alternative name for statistics. Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the University of Montpellier  II acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.\r\nThe term \"data science\" has been traced back to 1974, when Peter Naur proposed it as an alternative name to computer science. In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic. However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 C. F. Jeff Wu again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data. In 1998, Hayashi Chikio argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis.\r\n\r\nModern usage\r\nIn 2012, technologists Thomas H. Davenport and DJ Patil declared \"Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century\", a catchphrase that was picked up even by major-city newspapers like the New York Times and the Boston Globe. A decade later, they reaffirmed it, stating that \"the job is more in demand than ever with employers\".\r\nThe modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to William S. Cleveland. In 2014, the American Statistical Association's Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science.\r\nThe professional title of \"data scientist\" has been attributed to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008. Though it was used by the National Science Board in their 2005 report \"Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century\", it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection.\r\n\r\nData science and data analysis\r\nData analysis typically involves working with structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5136, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae044c30-7b4d-4b44-877c-bffb8a7125df": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae044c30-7b4d-4b44-877c-bffb8a7125df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b60856d-72ee-4682-b6b1-2edefcacd4c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "278f58d99bc55c4f68c7379cb45283c0018ce40e8075a81cf8d0a0fa3a270359", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c467a36c-fdb0-4885-9279-dfc34e757f4d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7bd8e21113e831ece9935272f889be139d36df14acbe185499b040ad220ba592", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A decade later, they reaffirmed it, stating that \"the job is more in demand than ever with employers\".\r\nThe modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to William S.

This can involve tasks such as data cleaning and data visualization to summarize data and develop hypotheses about relationships between variables. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data.\r\nData science involves working with larger datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with unstructured data such as text or images and use machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. Data science often uses statistical analysis, data preprocessing, and supervised learning.\r\n\r\nCloud computing for data science\r\nCloud computing can offer access to large amounts of computational power and storage. In big data, where volumes of information are continually generated and processed, these platforms can be used to handle complex and resource-intensive analytical tasks.\r\nSome distributed computing frameworks are designed to handle big data workloads. These frameworks can enable data scientists to process and analyze large datasets in parallel, which can reducing processing times.\r\n\r\nEthical consideration in data science\r\nData science involve collecting, processing, and analyzing data which often including personal and sensitive information. Ethical concerns include potential privacy violations, bias perpetuation, and negative societal impacts \r\nMachine learning models can amplify existing biases present in training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nPython (programming language)\r\nR (programming language)\r\nData engineering\r\nBig data\r\nMachine learning\r\nBioinformatics\r\nAstroinformatics\r\nTopological data analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Jeph Acheampong\r\nJeph Acheampong is a Ghanaian-American businessman.\r\nHe is an Expo Live Global Innovator, a World Economic Forum Global Shaper, and was named a Future of Ghana Pioneer.\r\n\r\nEarly life and education\r\nAcheampong was born in Accra, Ghana and grew up in New York.

The company's operations extend globally, with the primary aim as a joint-stock-company to increase profit for its shareholders.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nArt Recognition was established in 2019 by Carina Popovici and Christiane Hoppe-Oehl. The foundation of the company was driven by the long-standing challenge in the art world of authenticating paintings, a process traditionally reliant on expert judgment, historical research, and scientific analysis. Recognizing the limitations of existing methods, the co-founders were motivated by technological advancements in digital imaging and pattern recognition algorithms in the field of art.\r\nThese technological advancements, particularly in the realm of high-resolution digital imagery, enable a more detailed examination of artworks. By analyzing brushstrokes, signature patterns, and other distinct characteristics, and comparing them with known works by the same artist, digital tools offer a new dimension in authentication. Popovici and Hoppe-Oehl aimed to develop an advanced algorithm that could further assist experts by identifying stylistic elements and patterns unique to individual artists, thus aiding in the art authentication process.\r\n\r\nTechnology and methodology\r\nArt Recognition employs a combination of machine learning techniques, computer vision algorithms, and deep neural networks to assess the authenticity of artworks. The AI algorithm analyzes various visual characteristics, such as brushstrokes, color palette, texture, and composition, to identify patterns and similarities with known authentic artworks.\r\nThe company's technology undergoes a process of data collection, dataset preparation, and training. In the initial phase, datasets are compiled, and data selection is supervised by art historians to ensure the inclusion of genuine artworks by specific artists. This approach aims to avoid including artworks that may have been partially completed by apprentices or contain mixed authorship.\r\nUpon the preparation of datasets, a segment of the image set is used for training the AI algorithm, while the remaining images are set aside for testing. This phase aims to ensure the algorithm's proficiency in distinguishing authentic artworks from forgeries. Post-training, the algorithm undergoes evaluation with the test data, assessing its accuracy and efficacy in authenticating artworks.\r\nAfter the testing phase, the AI algorithm is applied to analyze new images, including submissions from clients. Additionally, the algorithm is designed to identify artworks generated by generative AI, mimicking the style of renowned artists. This capability equips the algorithm to withstand adversarial attacks, enhancing its reliability in differentiating between authentic and artificially generated fake art pieces.\r\n\r\nAcademic partnerships and grants\r\nArt Recognition's collaboration with Tilburg University in the Netherlands has resulted in the acquisition of a research grant from Eurostars,Eureka (organisation) the Eureka's flagship small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) funding program. In addition, the company has formed a partnership with the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom, which has been supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) Impact Acceleration Award.

This analysis contributed to ongoing scholarly discussions regarding the work's authenticity.\r\nDe Brecy Tondo Madonna. A research team from Bradford University and Nottingham University initially attributed the painting to Raphael, employing an AI face recognition software, while the AI developed at Art Recognition returned a negative result.  ***Redacted copyright violation***\r\nLucian Freud Painting Controversy: Featured in The New Yorker, a painting attributed to Lucian Freud became a subject of dispute. Art Recognition's AI analysis played a pivotal role in examining the painting's authenticity, contributing to the broader discussion about the challenges in verifying modern artworks.\r\nTitian at Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich: A painting attributed to Titian, housed at Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich, has been a topic of debate among art experts. The application of Art Recognition's technology offered a new perspective, utilizing AI to analyze the painting's stylistic elements in comparison with authenticated works of Titian. Following this debate, Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich has announced plans to initiate a comprehensive project aimed at resolving the authenticity questions surrounding the painting. This project is set to involve collaboration with scientists and technology companies, leveraging a multidisciplinary approach to authenticate the artwork.\r\nIn each of these instances, Art Recognition's involvement has provided additional perspectives through AI analysis while contributing to broader conversations about the role of technology in art authentication. These cases demonstrate the evolving nature of art verification, where traditional methods are being supplemented, and sometimes challenged, by new technological approaches. However, they also underline the ongoing debates about the acceptance of AI in the field of art history, especially in the authentication of works by renowned artists.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nExternal links\r\nOfficial website\r\nArt magazine website\r\n\r\nTitle: Artificial intelligence\r\nArtificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\r\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\r\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools.

The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence\u2014the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal level\u2014is among the field's long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\r\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the early 2020s many billions of dollars were being invested in AI and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the AI boom. The emergence of advanced generative AI in the midst of the AI boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of AI and its long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\r\n\r\nGoals\r\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\r\n\r\nReasoning and problem-solving\r\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\r\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\r\n\r\nKnowledge representation\r\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.\r\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; situations, events, states, and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\r\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.\r\n\r\nPlanning and decision-making\r\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences\u2014there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.\r\nIn classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 17177, "end_char_idx": 22507, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3228c3b-22ba-4d1f-9949-cda1fecdc816": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3228c3b-22ba-4d1f-9949-cda1fecdc816", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5768356-a156-43d1-b4f8-4deab0fdd3df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "4a842f7e6bbad30f7a4ea441f275b2eb3a48398085ecb74d101020f22da80b98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ff803e0-bbed-4e86-8cda-79d3b628b822", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3834da5361c5bbd91dd83edcaea2adc09113f30cdc107cc1bffd02963e86fbbc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.\r\n\r\nPlanning and decision-making\r\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world.

The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.\r\nIn classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.\r\nIn some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\r\nA Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.\r\nGame theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.\r\n\r\nLearning\r\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. It has been a part of AI from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).\r\nIn reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.\r\nComputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.\r\n\r\nNatural language processing\r\nNatural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.\r\nEarly work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\r\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), and others. In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.\r\n\r\nPerception\r\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world.

Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.\r\nThe field includes speech recognition, image classification, facial recognition, object recognition,object tracking, and robotic perception.\r\n\r\nSocial intelligence\r\nAffective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood. For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human\u2013computer interaction.\r\nHowever, this tends to give na\u00efve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.\r\n\r\nGeneral intelligence\r\nA machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.\r\n\r\nTechniques\r\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.\r\n\r\nSearch and optimization\r\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\r\n\r\nState space search\r\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.\r\nSimple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.\r\nAdversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.\r\n\r\nLocal search\r\nLocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.\r\nGradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks, through the backpropagation algorithm.\r\nAnother type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.\r\nDistributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).\r\n\r\nLogic\r\nFormal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.\r\nFormal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\") and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").\r\nDeductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises). Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.\r\nGiven a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 25672, "end_char_idx": 30677, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b53084a2-d994-43be-9757-6f43011f2cd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b53084a2-d994-43be-9757-6f43011f2cd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ff803e0-bbed-4e86-8cda-79d3b628b822", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "a5000a8836650efabb86177238df071d72d90ddbaf0abd8fb7faa79e9090ddb4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "14f267ea-6227-478b-adac-0f9c831b1d63", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b0d8f51d142b89f2994581082ab77cfe046804ea4259ce4baf93d30b07bf46f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises).

In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.\r\nInference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.\r\nFuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.\r\nNon-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning. Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.\r\n\r\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\r\nMany problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory. These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design.\r\nBayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation\u2013maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).\r\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).\r\n\r\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\r\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.\r\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use. The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.\r\nThe naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.\r\nNeural networks are also used as classifiers.\r\n\r\nArtificial neural networks\r\nAn artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.\r\nLearning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.\r\nIn feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events.

Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks. Perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons; deep learning uses multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other\u2014this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object.\r\n\r\nDeep learning\r\nDeep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.\r\nDeep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification, and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023. The sudden success of deep learning in 2012\u20132015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.\r\n\r\nGPT\r\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.\r\nCurrent models and services include Gemini (formerly Bard), ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot, and LLaMA. Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.\r\n\r\nHardware and software\r\nIn the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training.

The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer (CAO).\r\n\r\nHealth and medicine\r\nThe application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.\r\nFor medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein. In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.\r\n\r\nGames\r\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997. In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world. Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus. DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.\r\n\r\nMathematics\r\nLarge language models, such as GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, LLaMa or Mistral, are increasingly used in mathematics.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 37664, "end_char_idx": 42421, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09d4735f-f08c-45b6-9695-79c768d204ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "09d4735f-f08c-45b6-9695-79c768d204ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae919916-9823-49d6-94a4-d54c98c4f8e4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "d21e490b62b49093401a654a4dd3d549920ddddb7c7facf0b24f49686f1ab2df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "874d4f55-176c-43c7-952e-515408f14b84", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea7bb1c6592d90ae1856d0f7a5949a4dcd63cc01fb081469a5b8ae135d68d56f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games.

These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections. A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data. One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result. In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems.\r\nAlternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof all from Google DeepMind, Llemma from EleutherAI or Julius.\r\nWhen natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks.\r\nSome models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.\r\nTopological deep learning integrates various topological approaches.\r\n\r\nFinance\r\nFinance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years.\r\nWorld Pensions experts like Nicolas Firzli insist it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services: \"the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation.\"\r\n\r\nMilitary\r\nVarious countries are deploying AI military applications. The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams.\r\nAI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine.\r\n\r\nGenerative AI\r\nAgents\r\nArtificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.\r\n\r\nSexuality\r\nApplications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction, AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics), AI-generated sexual education content, and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika).  AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 41533, "end_char_idx": 46868, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "874d4f55-176c-43c7-952e-515408f14b84": {"__data__": {"id_": "874d4f55-176c-43c7-952e-515408f14b84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "09d4735f-f08c-45b6-9695-79c768d204ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "946b0fcf52e22d84c49e2259c2a5fc5b4c899b67ee035eddfc486bbc9442274a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5cf8bb84-50d2-42f5-bbd9-fdcacccb478f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9595d85ebb04e168e85b62e0880af2248fedbf060f3474f4ce90f2d4a17de17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations.

AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.\r\nAI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors.\r\n\r\nOther industry-specific tasks\r\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management.\r\nAI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Further, AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions.\r\nIn agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.\r\nArtificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.\r\nDuring the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 millions was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages.\r\n\r\nEthics\r\nAI has potential benefits and potential risks. AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.\r\n\r\nRisks and harm\r\nPrivacy and copyright\r\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\r\nAI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency.\r\nSensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio. For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.\r\nAI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy. Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness.

Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \"robots.txt\" file. In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.\r\n\r\nDominance by tech giants\r\nThe commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft. Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.\r\n\r\nPower needs and environmental impacts\r\nIn January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use. This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.\r\nProdigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources \u2013 from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that \u2013 in the long view \u2013 AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.\r\nA 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.\r\nIn 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for $650 Million (US). Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.\r\nIn September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 50330, "end_char_idx": 55074, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ac12658-7a11-4ff8-868c-5031fd014d61": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ac12658-7a11-4ff8-868c-5031fd014d61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5cf8bb84-50d2-42f5-bbd9-fdcacccb478f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "67f440df3eb1e659d8e4a0d3cf69e449f39064110dc4560d46f751243edbee04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c83c0bb-e177-4845-87f4-269d8d9be6a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6ed621d5730797198c5215c2bc769c5c53fc6458d6a12e876ecbc85aefa0102", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid.

Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power \u2013 enough for 800,000 homes \u2013 of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act. The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost $2 billion (US) to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation.\r\nAfter the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages. Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025. On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.\r\nAlthough most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.\r\nOn 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center. \r\nAccording to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.\r\n\r\nMisinformation\r\nYouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem .\r\nIn 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films, or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda. AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.\r\n\r\nAlgorithmic bias and fairness\r\nMachine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data. The developers may not be aware that the bias exists. Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed.

The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\r\nOn June 28, 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, a problem called \"sample size disparity\". Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.\r\nCOMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different\u2014the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. In 2017, several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.\r\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\"\r\nCriticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.\r\nBias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.\r\nThere are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 58079, "end_char_idx": 62665, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb0a308d-3b62-4341-9d2b-2d9b674885e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb0a308d-3b62-4341-9d2b-2d9b674885e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c83c0bb-e177-4845-87f4-269d8d9be6a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "00c648ac103dacbd531120993452d36fb0c84097f191cf1c9e1218f3c0e2c85e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "14f35441-943d-4c52-8e29-bc77b2d12d01", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "126dcf93fc168654f231c7fb2d552583f9a9a1bb875a5e53be71f6c242ae372c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness.

The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.\r\nAt its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.\r\n\r\nLack of transparency\r\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.\r\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.\r\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation. Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists. Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.\r\nDARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.\r\nSeveral approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model. Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning. For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.\r\n\r\nBad actors and weaponized AI\r\nArtificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.\r\nA lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person. In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed. By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.\r\nAI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways.

Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware. All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier\u2014AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.\r\nThere many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.\r\n\r\nTechnological unemployment\r\nEconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.\r\nIn the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI. A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed. Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.\r\nUnlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.\r\nFrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.\r\n\r\nExistential risk\r\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\". This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\r\nFirst, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager). Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\" In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".\r\nSecond, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 66057, "end_char_idx": 71097, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "124c359d-afd5-433b-8a03-f4e2f1d49ca7": {"__data__": {"id_": "124c359d-afd5-433b-8a03-f4e2f1d49ca7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "14f35441-943d-4c52-8e29-bc77b2d12d01", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "1bdb8948eb824a3cb3fb0032dc1be8144d3032ee5992951d23ec0298593756c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4892f23-9dba-4b63-b1ef-5fae6db27f5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7fd4b61e33d2373e590e1bdb316615f30481d1d5bb1665f775b83f8357170e05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\r\nFirst, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk.

The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are built on language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.\r\nThe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk, as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI.\r\nIn May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\". He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover, and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.\r\nIn 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".\r\nSome other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI\u2014and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine. However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.\r\n\r\nEthical machines and alignment\r\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.\r\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.\r\nThe field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,\r\nand was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.\r\nOther approaches include Wendell Wallach's \"artificial moral agents\" and Stuart J. Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.\r\n\r\nOpen source\r\nActive organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face, Google, EleutherAI and Meta.

They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.\r\n\r\nFrameworks\r\nArtificial Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and implementing an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values\u2014developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas:\r\n\r\nRespect the dignity of individual people\r\nConnect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively\r\nCare for the wellbeing of everyone\r\nProtect social values, justice, and the public interest\r\nOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; however, these principles do not go without their criticisms, especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks.\r\nPromotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.\r\nThe UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under a MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics. In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.\r\nIn a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\".

In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, such as McCullouch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible.\r\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.\r\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\". They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.\r\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.\r\nUp to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 78120, "end_char_idx": 82731, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfe8b591-f3f6-4194-a119-722720bf4939": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfe8b591-f3f6-4194-a119-722720bf4939", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "627c44f8-6b61-4e83-8903-1b8f4a32efe8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "75d0c50a62b20f119edf2dfa878754bb9f149d63adde91f1650af5b98b5c4404", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "875b5fa3-f4ce-4d99-9c6f-d3614eab77b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1782361ac335cdda3da627279ecc595e90ee1dc19688881f607f44e7b34154e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.\r\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts.

In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition, and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh, and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.\r\nAI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics). By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect).\r\nHowever, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.\r\nDeep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.\r\nFor many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.\r\nDeep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers, graphics processing units, cloud computing) and access to large amounts of data (including curated datasets, such as ImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015\u20132019.\r\nIn 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.\r\nIn the late teens and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. ChatGPT, launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\". About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022. According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy\r\nPhilosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.

Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will. Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.\r\n\r\nDefining artificial intelligence\r\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"\r\n\r\nRussell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'\" AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".\r\nMcCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky, similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine\u2014and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\r\nAnother definition has been adopted by Google, a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\r\nSome authors have suggested in practice, that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define, with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as AI, with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\".\r\n\r\nEvaluating approaches to AI\r\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\r\n\r\nSymbolic AI and its limits\r\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\") simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"\r\nHowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 85821, "end_char_idx": 90529, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fddda691-7a0e-4ec9-9c4a-c05cf6600244": {"__data__": {"id_": "fddda691-7a0e-4ec9-9c4a-c05cf6600244", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "875b5fa3-f4ce-4d99-9c6f-d3614eab77b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "33f852aa305c69fc674437b64d4484e9d986a0f3bf4c51bb2ec6406b87b04385", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aed6ab27-7c9f-494a-888c-f8ff782fcab1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce715338e8135f6197d4a7e5a381dd4e6dd8a9ce0022efdce602f27f1d65756f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow.

Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.\r\nThe issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\r\n\r\nNeat vs. scruffy\r\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\r\n\r\nSoft vs. hard computing\r\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\r\n\r\nNarrow vs. general AI\r\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\r\n\r\nMachine consciousness, sentience, and mind\r\nThe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\r\n\r\nConsciousness\r\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness. The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 89637, "end_char_idx": 94532, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aed6ab27-7c9f-494a-888c-f8ff782fcab1": {"__data__": {"id_": "aed6ab27-7c9f-494a-888c-f8ff782fcab1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fddda691-7a0e-4ec9-9c4a-c05cf6600244", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "ca65755f28971fcfd5d36729590ff07c57355c7b0e93006dc92e465ddd3c207a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "256d48f0-ec7f-4582-b0ae-dcd77c583a44", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "896f6473bb5a83a52793b9b5a1ba49eeba7cac1cd6292494761dd796ee025752", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind.

For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.\r\n\r\nComputationalism and functionalism\r\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind\u2013body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.\r\nPhilosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.\r\n\r\nAI welfare and rights\r\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.\r\nIn 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.\r\nProgress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.\r\n\r\nFuture\r\nSuperintelligence and the singularity\r\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".\r\nHowever, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.\r\n\r\nTranshumanism\r\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.\r\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.\r\n\r\nDecomputing\r\nArguments for decomputing have been raised by Dan McQuillan (Resisting AI: An Anti-fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence, 2022), meaning an opposition to the sweeping application and expansion of artificial intelligence.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 93573, "end_char_idx": 98482, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "256d48f0-ec7f-4582-b0ae-dcd77c583a44": {"__data__": {"id_": "256d48f0-ec7f-4582-b0ae-dcd77c583a44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aed6ab27-7c9f-494a-888c-f8ff782fcab1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "77b7316ef7ed3ff308b0f473d21595d039fa89c92dd04d890881ffd8320a893b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5786a253-6b95-4031-8012-cb5fb763adc7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "08d024a80446aa231cb3e3ce788cd05e855abb7c9669c4f554306818d6125207", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transhumanism\r\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either.

Similar to degrowth the approach criticizes AI as an outgrowth of the systemic issues and capitalist world we live in. Arguing that a different future is possible, in which distance between people is reduced and not increased to AI intermediaries.\r\n\r\nIn fiction\r\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.\r\nA common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.\r\nIsaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \"Multivac\" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.\r\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel \u010capek's R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nArtificial intelligence and elections \u2013 Use and impact of AI on political elections\r\nArtificial intelligence content detection \u2013 Software to detect AI-generated content\r\nBehavior selection algorithm \u2013 Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents\r\nBusiness process automation \u2013 Automation of business processes\r\nCase-based reasoning \u2013 Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems\r\nComputational intelligence \u2013 Ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation\r\nDigital immortality \u2013 Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form\r\nEmergent algorithm \u2013 Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior\r\nFemale gendering of AI technologies \u2013 Gender biases in digital technologyPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\r\nGlossary of artificial intelligence \u2013 List of definitions of terms and concepts commonly used in the study of artificial intelligence\r\nIntelligence amplification \u2013 Use of information technology to augment human intelligence\r\nIntelligent agent \u2013 Software agent which acts autonomously\r\nMind uploading \u2013 Hypothetical process of digitally emulating a brain\r\nOrganoid intelligence \u2013 Use of brain cells and brain organoids for intelligent computing\r\nRobotic process automation \u2013 Form of business process automation technology\r\nWetware computer \u2013 Computer composed of organic material\r\n\r\nExplanatory notes\r\nReferences\r\nAI textbooks\r\nThe two most widely used textbooks in 2023 (see the Open Syllabus):\r\n\r\nRussell, Stuart J.; Norvig, Peter (2021).

Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\r\n\r\nTitle: Artificial intelligence content detection\r\nArtificial intelligence detection software aims to determine whether some content (text, image, video or audio) was generated using artificial intelligence (AI).\r\nHowever, the reliability of such software is a topic of debate, and there are concerns about the potential misapplication of AI detection software by educators.\r\n\r\nAccuracy issues\r\nMultiple AI detection tools have been demonstrated to be unreliable in terms of accurately and comprehensively detecting AI-generated text. In a study conducted by Weber-Wulff et al., and published in 2023, researchers evaluated 14 detection tools including Turnitin and GPT Zero, and found that \"all scored below 80% of accuracy and only 5 over 70%.\"\r\n\r\nText detection\r\nFor text, this is usually done to prevent alleged plagiarism, often by detecting repetition of words as telltale signs that a text was AI-generated (including AI hallucinations). They are often used by teachers marking their students, usually on an ad hoc basis. Following the release of ChatGPT and similar AI text generative software, many educational establishments have issued policies against the use of AI by students. AI text detection software is also used by those assessing job applicants, as well as online search engines.\r\nCurrent detectors may sometimes be unreliable and have incorrectly marked work by humans as originating from AI while failing to detect AI-generated work in other instances. MIT Technology Review said that the technology \"struggled to pick up ChatGPT-generated text that had been slightly rearranged by humans and obfuscated by a paraphrasing tool\". AI text detection software has also been shown to discriminate against non-native speakers of English.\r\nTwo students from the University of California, Davis, were referred to the university's Office of Student Success and Judicial Affairs (OSSJA) after their professors scanned their essays with positive results; the first with an AI detector called GPTZero, and the second with an AI detector integration in Turnitin. However, following media coverage, and a thorough investigation, the students were cleared of any wrongdoing. \r\nIn April 2023, Cambridge University and other members of the Russell Group of universities in the United Kingdom opted out of Turnitin's AI text detection tool, after expressing concerns it was unreliable. The University of Texas at Austin opted out of the system six months later.\r\nIn May 2023, a professor at Texas A&M University\u2013Commerce used ChatGPT to detect whether his students' content was written by it, which ChatGPT said was the case. As such, he threatened to fail the class despite ChatGPT not being able to detect AI-generated writing. No students were prevented from graduating because of the issue, and all but one student (who admitted to using the software) were exonerated from accusations of having used ChatGPT in their content.\r\nAn article by Thomas Germain, published on Gizmodo in June 2024, reported job losses among freelance writers and journalists due to AI text detection software mistakenly classifying their work as AI-generated.\r\nTo improve the reliability of AI text detection, researchers have explored digital watermarking techniques. A 2023 paper titled \"A Watermark for Large Language Models\"  presents a method to embed imperceptible watermarks into text generated by large language models (LLMs).

A 2023 paper titled \"A Watermark for Large Language Models\"  presents a method to embed imperceptible watermarks into text generated by large language models (LLMs). This watermarking approach allows content to be flagged as AI-generated with a high level of accuracy, even when text is slightly paraphrased or modified. The technique is designed to be subtle and hard to detect for casual readers, thereby preserving readability, while providing a detectable signal for those employing specialized tools. However, while promising, watermarking faces challenges in remaining robust under adversarial transformations and ensuring compatibility across different LLMs.\r\n\r\nAnti text detection\r\nThere is software available designed to bypass AI text detection. \r\nA study published in August 2023 analyzed 20 abstracts from papers published in the Eye Journal, which were then paraphrased using GPT-4.0. The AI-paraphrased abstracts were examined for plagiarism using QueText and for AI-generated content using Originality.AI. The texts were then re-processed through an adversarial software called Undetectable.ai in order to reduce the AI-detection scores. The study found that the AI detection tool, Originality.AI, identified text generated by GPT-4 with a mean accuracy of 91.3%. However, after reprocessing by Undetectable.ai, the detection accuracy of Originality.ai dropped to a mean accuracy of 27.8%.\r\nSome experts also believe that techniques like digital watermarking are ineffective because they can be removed or added to trigger false positives. \"A Watermark for Large Language Models\" paper by Kirchenbauer et al.  also addresses potential vulnerabilities of watermarking techniques. The authors outline a range of adversarial tactics, including text insertion, deletion, and substitution attacks, that could be used to bypass watermark detection. These attacks vary in complexity, from simple paraphrasing to more sophisticated approaches involving tokenization and homoglyph alterations. The study highlights the challenge of maintaining watermark robustness against attackers who may employ automated paraphrasing tools or even specific language model replacements to alter text spans iteratively while retaining semantic similarity. Experimental results show that although such attacks can degrade watermark strength, they also come at the cost of text quality and increased computational resources.\r\n\r\nMultilingual text detection\r\nOne shortcoming of most AI content detection software is their inability to identify AI-generated text in any language. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini can write in different languages, but traditional AI text detection tools have primarily been trained in English and a few other widely spoken languages, such as French and Spanish. Fewer AI detection solutions can detect AI-generated text in languages like Farsi, Arabic, or Hindi.\r\n\r\nImage, video, and audio detection\r\nSeveral purported AI image detection software exist, to detect AI-generated images (for example, those originating from Midjourney or DALL-E). They are not completely reliable. \r\nOthers claim to identify video and audio deepfakes, but this technology is also not fully reliable yet either. \r\nDespite debate around the efficacy of watermarking, Google DeepMind is actively developing a detection software called SynthID, which works by inserting a digital watermark that is invisible to the human eye into the pixels of an image.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nAI alignment\r\nArtificial intelligence and elections\r\nContent similarity detection\r\nHallucination (artificial intelligence)\r\nNatural language processing\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Biomedical data science\r\nBiomedical data science is a multidisciplinary field which leverages large volumes of data to promote biomedical innovation and discovery.

The scope of the journal encompasses informatics, computational, and statistical approaches to biomedical data, including the sub-fields of bioinformatics, computational biology, biomedical informatics, clinical and clinical research informatics, biostatistics, and imaging informatics. The mission of the journal is to identify both emerging and established areas of biomedical data science, and the leaders in these fields.\u201d \r\nOther journals have a more general scope than biomedical data science, but regularly publish biomedical data science research such as Health Data Science and Nature Machine Intelligence.

Significant computational resources were required to process the data in the HGP, as the human genome contains over 6 billion DNA base pairs. Scientists constructed the genome by piecing together small fragments of DNA, and computing overlaps between these sequences alone required over 10,000 CPU hours. At this massive data scale, scientists relied on advanced algorithms to perform data processing steps such as sequence assembly and sequence alignment for quality control. Some of these algorithms, such as BLAST, are still used in modern bioinformatics. Scientists in the HGP also had to address complexities often associated with biomedical data including noisy data, such as DNA read errors, and privacy rights of the research subjects.

The field is closely related to astrostatistics.\r\nData-driven astronomy (DDA) refers to the use of data science in astronomy. Several outputs of telescopic observations and sky surveys are taken into consideration and approaches related to data mining and big data management are used to analyze, filter, and normalize the data set that are further used for making Classifications, Predictions, and Anomaly detections by advanced Statistical approaches, digital image processing and machine learning. The output of these processes is used by astronomers and space scientists to study and identify patterns, anomalies, and movements in outer space and conclude theories and discoveries in the cosmos.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nAstroinformatics is primarily focused on developing the tools, methods, and applications of computational science, data science, machine learning, and statistics for research and education in data-oriented astronomy. Early efforts in this direction included data discovery, metadata standards development, data modeling, astronomical data dictionary development, data access, information retrieval, data integration, and data mining in the astronomical Virtual Observatory initiatives. Further development of the field, along with astronomy community endorsement, was presented to the National Research Council (United States) in 2009 in the astroinformatics \"state of the profession\" position paper for the 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey. That position paper provided the basis for the subsequent more detailed exposition of the field in the Informatics Journal paper Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy Research and Education.\r\nAstroinformatics as a distinct field of research was inspired by work in the fields of Geoinformatics, Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics, and through the eScience work of Jim Gray (computer scientist) at Microsoft Research, whose legacy was remembered and continued through the Jim Gray eScience Awards.\r\nAlthough the primary focus of astroinformatics is on the large worldwide distributed collection of digital astronomical databases, image archives, and research tools, the field recognizes the importance of legacy data sets as well\u2014using modern technologies to preserve and analyze historical astronomical observations. Some Astroinformatics practitioners help to digitize historical and recent astronomical observations and images in a large database for efficient retrieval through web-based interfaces. Another aim is to help develop new methods and software for astronomers, as well as to help facilitate the process and analysis of the rapidly growing amount of data in the field of astronomy.\r\nAstroinformatics is described as the \"fourth paradigm\" of astronomical research. There are many research areas involved with astroinformatics, such as data mining, machine learning, statistics, visualization, scientific data management, and semantic science. Data mining and machine learning play significant roles in astroinformatics as a scientific research discipline due to their focus on \"knowledge discovery from data\" (KDD) and \"learning from data\".\r\nThe amount of data collected from astronomical sky surveys has grown from gigabytes to terabytes throughout the past decade and is predicted to grow in the next decade into hundreds of petabytes with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and into the exabytes with the Square Kilometre Array. This plethora of new data both enables and challenges effective astronomical research. Therefore, new approaches are required. In part due to this, data-driven science is becoming a recognized academic discipline. Consequently, astronomy (and other scientific disciplines) are developing information-intensive and data-intensive sub-disciplines to an extent that these sub-disciplines are now becoming (or have already become) standalone research disciplines and full-fledged academic programs. While many institutes of education do not boast an astroinformatics program, such programs most likely will be developed in the near future.\r\nInformatics has been recently defined as \"the use of digital data, information, and related services for research and knowledge generation\".

Classification schemes (e.g., taxonomies, ontologies, folksonomies, and/or collaborative tagging) plus Astrostatistics will also be heavily involved. Citizen science projects (such as Galaxy Zoo) also contribute highly valued novelty discovery, feature meta-tagging, and object characterization within large astronomy data sets. All of these specialties enable scientific discovery across varied massive data collections, collaborative research, and data re-use, in both research and learning environments.\r\nIn 2007, the Galaxy Zoo project was launched for morphological classification of a large number of galaxies. In this project, 900,000 images were considered for classification that were taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) for the past 7 years. The task was to study each picture of a galaxy, classify it as elliptical or spiral, and determine whether it was spinning or not. The team of Astrophysicists led by Kevin Schawinski in Oxford University were in charge of this project and Kevin and his colleague Chris Linlott figured out that it would take a period of 3\u20135 years for such a team to complete the work. There they came up with the idea of using Machine Learning and Data Science techniques for analyzing the images and classifying them.\r\nIn 2012, two position papers were presented to the Council of the American Astronomical Society that led to the establishment of formal working groups in astroinformatics and Astrostatistics for the profession of astronomy within the US and elsewhere.\r\nAstroinformatics provides a natural context for the integration of education and research. The experience of research can now be implemented within the classroom to establish and grow data literacy through the easy re-use of data. It also has many other uses, such as repurposing archival data for new projects, literature-data links, intelligent retrieval of information, and many others.\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nThe data retrieved from the sky surveys are first brought for data preprocessing. In this, redundancies are removed and filtrated. Further, feature extraction is performed on this filtered data set, which is further taken for processes. Some of the renowned sky surveys are listed below:\r\n\r\nThe Palomar Digital Sky Survey (DPOSS)\r\nThe Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)\r\nGreen Bank Telescope (GBT)\r\nThe Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)\r\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\r\nSkyMapper Southern Sky Survey (SMSS)\r\nThe Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (PanSTARRS)\r\nThe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)\r\nThe Square Kilometer Array (SKA)\r\nThe size of data from the above-mentioned sky surveys ranges from 3 TB to almost 4.6 EB.

Jones. The book explores the history of data and statistics from the end of the 18th century to the present day.\r\n\r\nContent\r\nThe book starts at the end of the 18th century, when European states began tabulating physical resources, and ends at the present day, when algorithms manipulate our personal information as a commodity. It looks at the rise of data and statistics, and how early statistical methods were used to justify eugenics, quantify supposed racial differences, and develop military and industrial applications. The authors also discuss the impact of the internet and e-commerce on data collection, the rise of data science, and the consequences of government-run surveillance systems collecting vast amounts of personal data for customized, targeted advertising. They emphasize the importance of privacy and democracy and propose remedies to the problems caused by mass data collection, including stronger regulation of the tech industry and collective action by its employees. The book is a historical analysis that provides context for understanding the debates surrounding data and its control.\r\nThe book has 336 pages and was published in 2023 by W. W. Norton & Company.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nExternal links\r\nThe wild evolution of data science and how to unpack it, book excerpt on Big Think\r\nFrom Eugenics to Targeted Advertising: The Dark Role of Data in Sorting Humanity, book excerpt on Literary Hub\r\n\r\nTitle: List of important publications in data science\r\nThis is a list of important publications in data science, generally organized by order of use in a data analysis workflow.\r\n\r\nSee the list of important publications in statistics for more research-based and fundamental publications; while this list is more applied, business oriented, and cross-disciplinary.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 122200, "end_char_idx": 127397, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c8207d4-63fa-4096-8814-ab384b067684": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c8207d4-63fa-4096-8814-ab384b067684", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "001a995d-dff7-40cf-949e-8aaec9b88deb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "b7078dfe421e87fcf56a7b0e6626fe18dede5739b9f496f496fd491ee4abf1ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "68ae97c8-4ef2-4e50-b08e-bb4b59ec57fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "210283deffb5a5acff21ba5bb92fa5ac369c88654c96d9486178d8611900cd9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "They emphasize the importance of privacy and democracy and propose remedies to the problems caused by mass data collection, including stronger regulation of the tech industry and collective action by its employees.

Breiman argues that while statistics has traditionally favored using the stochastic model, there is value in expanding the methods that statisticians can use to study phenomenon.\r\nImportance: Influence on the philosophies of statisticians right before the increased use of machine learning and deep learning methods. In a 20-year retrospective on this article, \"Breiman's words are perhaps more relevant than ever\". Notable statisticians at the time wrote opinion pieces about the publication. Although overall critical of the publication, David Cox writes that the publication \"contains enough truth and exposes enough weaknesses to be thought-provoking.\" Bradley Efron commented that this publication is a \"stimulating paper\".

Model-based clustering based on a statistical model for the data, usually a mixture model.

The Bayesian approach also allows for the case where the number of components, \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        G\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    {\\displaystyle G}\r\n  \r\n, is infinite, using a Dirichlet process prior, yielding a Dirichlet process mixture model for clustering.\r\n\r\nChoosing the number of clusters\r\nAn advantage of model-based clustering is that it provides statistically\r\nprincipled ways to choose the number of clusters.

The classification was quite accurate, with a 12% error rate\r\nas defined by the clinical classificiation.\r\nOther well-known clustering methods performed worse with higher\r\nerror rates, such as single-linkage clustering with 46%,\r\naverage link clustering with 30%, complete-linkage clustering\r\nalso with 30%, and k-means clustering with 28%.\r\n\r\nOutliers in clustering\r\nAn outlier in clustering is a data point that does not belong to any of\r\nthe clusters. One way of modeling outliers in model-based clustering is\r\nto include an additional mixture component that is very dispersed, with\r\nfor example a uniform distribution. Another approach is to replace the multivariate \r\nnormal densities by \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        t\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    {\\displaystyle t}\r\n  \r\n-distributions, with the idea that the long tails of the\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        t\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    {\\displaystyle t}\r\n  \r\n-distribution would ensure robustness to outliers.\r\nHowever, this is not breakdown-robust.\r\nA third approach is the \"tclust\" or data trimming approach\r\n which excludes observations identified as\r\noutliers when estimating the model parameters.\r\n\r\nNon-Gaussian clusters and merging\r\nSometimes one or more clusters deviate strongly from the Gaussian assumption.\r\nIf a Gaussian mixture is fitted to such data, a strongly non-Gaussian \r\ncluster will often be represented by several mixture components rather than\r\na single one. In that case, cluster merging can be used to find a better\r\nclustering. A different approach is to use mixtures\r\nof complex component densities to represent non-Gaussian clusters.\r\n\r\nNon-continuous data\r\nCategorical data\r\nClustering multivariate categorical data is most often done using the\r\nlatent class model. This assumes that the data arise from a finite\r\nmixture model, where within each cluster the variables are independent.\r\n\r\nMixed data\r\nThese arise when variables are of different types, such\r\nas continuous, categorical or ordinal data. A latent class model for\r\nmixed data assumes local independence between the variable. The location model relaxes the local independence\r\nassumption. The clustMD approach assumes that\r\nthe observed variables are manifestations of underlying continuous Gaussian\r\nlatent variables.\r\n\r\nCount data\r\nThe simplest model-based clustering approach for multivariate\r\ncount data is based on finite mixtures with locally independent Poisson\r\ndistributions, similar to the latent class model. \r\nMore realistic approaches allow for dependence and overdispersion in the \r\ncounts. \r\nThese include methods based on the multivariate Poisson distribution,\r\nthe multivarate Poisson-log normal distribution, the integer-valued\r\nautoregressive (INAR) model and the Gaussian Cox model.\r\n\r\nSequence data\r\nThese consist of sequences of categorical values from a finite set of \r\npossibilities, such as life course trajectories.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 145560, "end_char_idx": 150483, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8f11b05-7a5a-4c92-8561-e399cf1fe393": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8f11b05-7a5a-4c92-8561-e399cf1fe393", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a180b619-3040-4738-b5b8-0df1a08d6207", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "ca49b98a9c093ddd3953316b8a9bc3583514b987f8639e455febbbe0658c279f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2d38a3a7-5cfe-421e-ae14-7ee0ad4eab84", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f1a9f3e79876c961cfd4c9f2691a6664431f03fad02a15c2c559e61700e0f7b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Mixed data\r\nThese arise when variables are of different types, such\r\nas continuous, categorical or ordinal data.

Many of these are listed in the\r\nCRAN Task View on Cluster Analysis and Finite Mixture Models.\r\nThe most used such package is\r\nmclust, \r\nwhich is used to cluster continuous data and has been downloaded over \r\n8 million times.\r\nThe poLCA package  clusters\r\ncategorical data using the latent class model. \r\nThe clustMD package  clusters\r\nmixed data, including continuous, binary, ordinal and nominal variables.\r\nThe flexmix package \r\ndoes model-based clustering for a range of component distributions.\r\nThe mixtools package  can cluster\r\ndifferent data types. Both flexmix and mixtools\r\nimplement model-based clustering with covariates.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nModel-based clustering was first invented in 1950 by Paul Lazarsfeld\r\nfor clustering multivariate discrete data, in the form of the \r\nlatent class model.\r\nIn 1959, Lazarsfeld gave a lecture on latent structure analysis \r\nat the University of California-Berkeley, where John H. Wolfe was an M.A. student.\r\nThis led Wolfe to think about how to do the same thing for continuous\r\ndata, and in 1965 he did so, proposing the Gaussian mixture model for \r\nclustering.\r\nHe also produced the first software for estimating it, called NORMIX.\r\nDay (1969), working independently, was the first to publish a journal\r\narticle on the approach.\r\nHowever, Wolfe deserves credit as the inventor of model-based clustering\r\nfor continuous data.\r\nMurtagh and Raftery (1984) developed a model-based clustering method\r\nbased on the eigenvalue decomposition of the component covariance matrices. \r\nMcLachlan and Basford (1988) was the first book on the approach, \r\nadvancing methodology and sparking interest.\r\nBanfield and Raftery (1993) coined the term \"model-based clustering\",\r\nintroduced the family of parsimonious models,  \r\ndescribed an information criterion for\r\nchoosing the number of clusters, proposed the uniform model for outliers,\r\nand introduced the mclust software.\r\nCeleux and Govaert (1995) showed how to perform maximum likelihood estimation \r\nfor the models. \r\nThus, by 1995 the core components of the methodology were in place, \r\nlaying the groundwork for extensive development since then.\r\n\r\nFurther reading\r\nScrucca, L.; Fraley, C.; Murphy, T.B.; Raftery, A.E.

The OHDSI effort includes diverse researchers and health databases worldwide, with its central coordinating center located at Columbia University.\r\nThe group was derived from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP), a public-private consortium based in the United States of America, created with the goal of improving the state of observational health data for better drug development, which started in response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Amendments Act of 2007. OMOP developed a Common Data Model (CDM), standardizing the way observational data is represented. After OMOP ended, this standard started being maintained and updated by OHDSI.\r\nAs of February 2024, the most recent CDM is at version 6.0, while version 5.4 is the stable version used by most tools in the OMOP ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nHealth informatics\r\nOpen science\r\nBig data\r\nLegacy OMOP methods\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nExternal links\r\nOHDSI official website\r\nLegacy OMOP methods\r\n\r\nTitle: Persistence barcode\r\nIn topological data analysis, a persistence barcode, sometimes shortened to barcode, is an algebraic invariant associated with a filtered chain complex or a persistence module that characterizes the stability of topological features throughout a growing family of spaces. Formally, a persistence barcode consists of a multiset of intervals in the extended real line, where the length of each interval corresponds to the lifetime of a topological feature in a filtration, usually built on a point cloud, a  graph, a  function, or, more generally, a simplicial complex or a chain complex. Generally, longer intervals in a barcode correspond to more robust features, whereas shorter intervals are more likely to be noise in the data. A persistence barcode is a complete invariant that captures all the topological information in a filtration. In algebraic topology, the persistence barcodes were first introduced by Sergey Barannikov in 1994 as the \"canonical forms\" invariants consisting of a multiset of line segments with ends on two parallel lines, and later, in geometry processing, by Gunnar Carlsson et al. in 2004.\r\n\r\nDefinition\r\nLet \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          F\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} }\r\n  \r\n be a fixed field.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 153625, "end_char_idx": 157483, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f65d169-4296-45e5-9ac1-172c124bc51c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f65d169-4296-45e5-9ac1-172c124bc51c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d38a3a7-5cfe-421e-ae14-7ee0ad4eab84", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "abf5af97d3f89ae31f016f5a050fd3b93742cf37e3ec3aa403817d6e8d5ad5a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a85ea6f5-a75e-469a-b6dc-a9e9ea25a81a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "588fde1361d0363f929fbcd05a37862699d7c2919639fa70b0bfdea2c940ab33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Generally, longer intervals in a barcode correspond to more robust features, whereas shorter intervals are more likely to be noise in the data.

It has the main goals to engage people and to communicate data using computer-supported physical data representations.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nBefore the invention of computers and digital devices, the application of data physicalization already existed in ancient artifacts as a medium to represent abstract information. One example is Blombo ocher plaque which is estimated to be 70000 \u2013 80000 years old. The geometric and iconographic shapes engraved at the surface of the artifact demonstrated the cognitive complexity of ancient humans. Moreover, since such representations were deliberately made and crafted, the evidences suggest that the geometric presentation of information is a popular methodology in the context of society. Although researchers still cannot decipher the specific type of information encoded in the artifact, there are several proposed interpretations. For example, the potential functions of the artifact are divided into four categories, categorized as \"numerical\", \"functional\", \"cognitive\", and \"social\". Later, at around 35,000 B.C, another artifact, the Lebombo bone, emerged and the encoded information became easier to read. There are around 29 distinct notches carved on the baboon fibula. It is estimated that the number of notches is closely related to the number of lunar cycles. Moreover, this early counting system was also regarded as the birth of calculation.\r\nRight before the invention of writing, the clay token system was spread across ancient Mesopotamia. When the buyers and sellers want to make a trade, they prepare a set of tokens and seal them inside the clay envelope after impressing the shape on the surface. Such physical entity was widely used in trading, administrative documents, and agricultural settlement. Moreover, the token system is evidence of the early counting system. Each shape corresponds to a physical meaning such as the representation of \"sheep\", forming a one-to-one mapping relationship. The significance of the token is it uses physical shape to encode numerical information and it is regarded as the precursor of the early writing system. The logical reason is the two-dimension symbol would record the same information as the impression created by the clay token.\r\nFrom 3000 BCE to the 17th century, a more complex visual encoding, Quipus, was developed and widely used in Andean South America. Knotted strings unrelated to quipu have also been used to record information by the ancient Chinese, Tibetans and Japanese. The ancient Inca empire used it for military and taxation purposes. The Base-10 logical-numerical system can record information based on the relative distance of knots, the color of the knots, and the type of knots. Due to the texture (cotton) of Quipus, very few of them survive.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 165276, "end_char_idx": 170106, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84f2fa71-d713-4464-9ba7-7e5044e5c17b": {"__data__": {"id_": "84f2fa71-d713-4464-9ba7-7e5044e5c17b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7d00aa4-8767-4e52-84f9-2eb817708e9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "cb2c95621323c87b62de3a7fc388ac7762ab59925034cfc9333f1debc1408889", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b6e141c-04da-43a3-80f8-865797296279", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "14e8107ec872e8ff993e1ac84d5894507710defd176e76d4873d950079f33e78", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The significance of the token is it uses physical shape to encode numerical information and it is regarded as the precursor of the early writing system.

The Base-10 logical-numerical system can record information based on the relative distance of knots, the color of the knots, and the type of knots. Due to the texture (cotton) of Quipus, very few of them survive. By analyzing those remaining artifacts, Erland Nordenski\u00f6ld proposed that Quipus is the only writing system used by Inca, and the information encoding technique is sophisticated and distinctive.\r\nThe idea of data physicalization become popular since the 17th century in which architects and engineers widely used such methods in civil engineering and city management. For example, from 1663 to 1867, Plan-relief model was used to visualize French territorial structure and important military units such as citadels and walled cities. Therefore, one of the functions of the Plan-relief model was to plan defense or offense. It is worth noting that the model can be categorized as a military technology and it did not encode any abstract information. The tradition of using tangible models to represent buildings and architectures still remains today.\r\nOne of the contemporary examples of data physicalization is the Galton board designed by Francis Galton who promoted the concept of Regression toward the mean. The Galton board, a very useful tool in approximating the Gaussian law of errors, consists of evenly spaced nails and vertical slats at the bottom of the board. After a large number of marbles are released, they will settle down at the bottom, forming the contour of a Bell Curve. Most marbles will agglomerate at the center (smaller deviation) with few on the edge of the board.\r\nIn 1935, three different electricity companies (e.g. Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Commonwealth Edison Company) created an electricity data physicalization model to visualize the power consumption of their customers so that the company can better forecast the upcoming power demand. The model has one short axis and one long axis. The short axis indicates \"day\", whereas the long axis spans the whole year. The viewers can gain perspective on when customers consume electricity the most during the day and how does the consumption change across different seasons. The model was built manually by cutting wooden sheets and stacked all pieces together.\r\nResearchers began to realize that data physicalization models can not only help agents manage/plan certain tasks, but also can greatly simplify very complex problems by letting users manipulate data in the real world. Therefore, from an epistemic perspective, physical manipulation enables users to uncover hidden patterns that cannot be easily detected. Max Perutz received Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1962 for his distinguished work in discovering the structure of the globular protein. When a narrow X-ray passes through the haemoglobin molecule, the diffraction pattern can review the inner structure of the atomic arrangements. One of Perutz's works within this research involved creating a physicalized haemoglobin molecule which enables him to manipulate and inspect the structure in a tangible way.\r\nIn the book, Bertin designed a matrices visualization device called Domino which let users manipulate row and column data. The combination of row and column can be considered as a two-dimensional data space. In Semiology of Graphics, Bertain defined what variables can be reordered and what variables cannot. For example, time can be considered as a one direction variable. We should keep it in a natural order. Compared with the aforementioned work, this model emphasized the visual thinking aspect of data physicalization and supports a variety of data types such as maps, matrices, and timelines. By adjusting the data entries, an analyst can find patterns inside the datasets and repeatedly use Domino on different datasets.\r\nMore recent physicalization examples include using LEGO bricks to keep track of project progress. For example, people used LEGO to record their thesis writing progress. Users can use the LEGO board to set concrete steps before pushing to real publications such as data analysis, data collection, development, etc. Another application involves using LEGO in bug tracking. For software engineers, keeping track of the issue of the code base is a crucial task and LEGO simplify this progress by physicalize the issues.\r\nA specific application of data physicalization involves building tactile maps for visually impaired people.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 169292, "end_char_idx": 174317, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b6e141c-04da-43a3-80f8-865797296279": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b6e141c-04da-43a3-80f8-865797296279", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "84f2fa71-d713-4464-9ba7-7e5044e5c17b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "dbfdfc53c56bf2109098c0b7ab1e2e831fefb44ba02ab8165b531437cb1943b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "576ecc9b-e909-4ec9-877e-82829eeb3464", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "956ea437a7fb88c7a078379000cd57d26f24cb9915d1074551a9c6efa6b131c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For example, time can be considered as a one direction variable.

With the help of digital fabrication tool such as laser cutter, researchers in Fab Lab at RWTH Aachen University has used it to produce relief-based a tactile map to support visually impaired users. Some tangible user interface researchers combined TUI with tactile maps to render dynamic rendering and enhance collaboration between vision impaired people (e.g. FluxMarkers).\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Social data science\r\nSocial data science is an interdisciplinary field that addresses social science problems by applying or designing computational and digital methods. As the name implies, Social Data Science is located primarily within the social science, but it relies on technical advances in fields like data science, network science, and computer science. The data in Social Data Science is always about human beings and derives from social phenomena, and it could be structured data (e.g. surveys) or unstructured data (e.g. digital footprints). The goal of Social Data Science is to yield new knowledge about social networks, human behavior, cultural ideas and political ideologies.\r\nA social data scientist combines domain knowledge and specialized theories from the social sciences with programming, statistical and other data analysis skills.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nSocial data science employs a wide range of quantitative - both established methods in social science as well as new methods developed in computer science and interdisciplinary data science fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and network science.\r\nSocial Data Science is closely related to Computational Social Science, but also sometimes includes qualitative data, and mixed digital methods.\r\nCommon social data science methods include:\r\nQuantitative methods:\r\n\r\nMachine learning\r\nDeep learning\r\nSocial network analysis\r\nRandomized controlled trials\r\nNatural language processing (NLP), especially through text as data.\r\nsurveys\r\nQualitative methods:\r\n\r\nInterviewing\r\nObservation\r\nEthnography\r\nContent analysis\r\nDiscourse analysis\r\nMixed digital methods:\r\n\r\nControversy mapping\r\nSpatial analysis\r\nQuali-quantitative methods \r\nComputational ethnography\r\nOne of the pillars of social data science is in the combination of qualitative and quantitative data to analyze social phenomena and develop computationally grounded theories. For example, by using mixed methods to digitize qualitative data and analyzing it via computational methods, or by qualitatively analyzing and interpreting quantitative data.\r\n\r\nData\r\nSocial data scientists use both digitized data  (e.g. old books that have been digitized) and natively digital data (e.g. social media posts). Since such data often take the form of found data that were originally produced for other purposes (commercial, governance, etc.) than research, data scraping, cleaning and other forms of preprocessing and data mining occupy a substantial part of a social data scientist's job.\r\nSources of SDS data include:\r\n\r\nText data\r\nSensor data\r\nRegister data\r\nSurvey data\r\nGeo-location data\r\nObservational data\r\n\r\nRelations to other fields\r\nSocial sciences\r\nSocial data science is part of the social sciences along with established disciplines (anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology) and newer interdisciplinary fields like behavioral science, criminology, international relations, and cognitive science. As such, its fundamental unit of study is social relations, human behavior and cultural ideas, which it investigates by using quantitative and/or qualitative data and methods to develop, test and improve fundamental theories concerning the nature of the human condition. SDS also differs from traditional social science in two ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, its primary object is digitized phenomena and data in the widest sense of this word, ranging from digitized text corpora to the footprints gathered by digital platforms and sensors.\r\nSecondly, more than simply applying existing quantitative and qualitative social science methods, social data science seeks to develop and disrupt these via the import and integration of state of the art of data science techniques\r\n\r\nData Science\r\nSocial data science is a form of data science in that it applies advanced computational methods and statistics to gain information and insights from data.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 173272, "end_char_idx": 178686, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "576ecc9b-e909-4ec9-877e-82829eeb3464": {"__data__": {"id_": "576ecc9b-e909-4ec9-877e-82829eeb3464", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b6e141c-04da-43a3-80f8-865797296279", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "15ca7cb5ac5ec01477338dcb2a1907378d40fee304cc63bdc6264fcb5c8171bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b517fdcb-26f5-4750-8367-d0dd5e52fbad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0571e817e09cc79142ea23fde186b69fbfdf4706164481f50258fecf98f5d5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "As such, its fundamental unit of study is social relations, human behavior and cultural ideas, which it investigates by using quantitative and/or qualitative data and methods to develop, test and improve fundamental theories concerning the nature of the human condition.

Social data science researchers often make use of methods developed by data scientists, such as data mining and machine learning, which includes but is not limited to the extraction and processing of information from big data sources. Unlike the broader field of data science, which involves any application and study involving the combination of computational and statistical methods, social data science mainly concerns the scientific study of digital social data and/or digital footprints from human behavior.\r\n\r\nComputational Social Science\r\nLike computational social science, social data science uses data science methods to solve social science problems. This includes the reappropriation and refinement of methods developed by data scientists to better fit the questions and data of the social sciences as well as their specialized domain knowledge and theories. Unlike computational social science, social data science also includes critical studies of how digital platforms and computational processes affect wider society and of how computational and non-computational approaches integrate and combine.\r\n\r\nDigital Methods\r\nWhile most social data science researchers are closely affiliated with or part of computational social science, some qualitative oriented social data scientists are influenced by the fields of digital humanities and digital methods that emerged from science and technology studies (STS). Like digital methods, the aim is here to repurpose the 'methods of the medium' to study digitally-mediated society and to engage in an ongoing discussions about bias in science and society by bringing computational social science and Digital Methods into dialogue. SDS is also related to digital sociology and digital anthropology, but to a higher degree aspires to augment qualitative data and digital methods with state of the art data science techniques.\r\n\r\nHistory of the field\r\nThe origin of term \"social data science\" coincided with the emergence of a number of research centers and degree programs. In 2016, the Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science (SODAS) - the first academic institution using the SDS name - was launched at the University of Copenhagen. The plan for an interdisciplinary center working at the intersection of the social and computational sciences was rooted in the Copenhagen Networks Study  from 2011 to 2016 by researchers from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and the University of Copenhagen. The University of Oxford and the University of Copenhagen were among the first research institutions to offer degree programmes in SDS. In 2018, the University of Oxford launched the one-year MSc in Social Data Science,  which was followed by the two-year master's programme at the University of Copenhagen in 2020. Since then, an increasing number of universities have begun to offer graduate programs or specializations in social data science\r\nSocial data science has emerged after the increasing availability of digitized social data, sometimes referred to as Big Data, and the ability to apply computational methods to this data at a low cost, which has offered novel opportunities to  address questions about social phenomena and human behavior. While the origin of social data can be traced back to 1890s (when some 15 million individual records were processed by the US Census in the form of punch cards), the social data boom in the 21th century is a direct consequence of the increasing availability of consumer data resulting from the advent of e-commerce Subsequent waves of availability of unstructured social data include Amazon.com review system and Wikipedia, and more recently, social media, which has played a key role in the emergence of the digital attention economy and big tech.\r\n\r\nCriticism and debates\r\nData scientists have played a vital role in the data revolution, both during the original tech-optimist phase where big data and the Internet was seen as the solution to many societal and scientific problems, and as participants  in the tech-lash that followed in its wake as result of, among other things, the Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 177758, "end_char_idx": 182825, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b517fdcb-26f5-4750-8367-d0dd5e52fbad": {"__data__": {"id_": "b517fdcb-26f5-4750-8367-d0dd5e52fbad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "576ecc9b-e909-4ec9-877e-82829eeb3464", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "f570212c93f33d5316cfca7c1f218364728f63dcbd30ff7e5e697b7cb7c3cf8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b25d74f7-ffae-4d84-a54b-5b6d7f2a2ec1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "892deaaa7ea18f7ab02d2c95279ad621b3209626cf0e01681eb7f1d38d5d23c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "While the origin of social data can be traced back to 1890s (when some 15 million individual records were processed by the US Census in the form of punch cards), the social data boom in the 21th century is a direct consequence of the increasing availability of consumer data resulting from the advent of e-commerce Subsequent waves of availability of unstructured social data include Amazon.com review system and Wikipedia, and more recently, social media, which has played a key role in the emergence of the digital attention economy and big tech.\r\n\r\nCriticism and debates\r\nData scientists have played a vital role in the data revolution, both during the original tech-optimist phase where big data and the Internet was seen as the solution to many societal and scientific problems, and as participants  in the tech-lash that followed in its wake as result of, among other things, the Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal.

It is worth nothing that \"statistical thinking\" is not the same as \"quantitative literacy\", although there is overlap in interpreting numbers and data visualizations.\r\nStatistical thinking relates processes and statistics, and is based on the following principles:\r\n\r\nAll work occurs in a system of interconnected processes.\r\nVariation exists in all processes\r\nUnderstanding and reducing variation are keys to success.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nW. Edwards Deming promoted the concepts of statistical thinking, using two powerful experiments:\r\n1. The Red Bead experiment, in which workers are tasked with running a more or less random procedure, yet the lowest \"performing\" workers are fired. The experiment demonstrates how the natural variability in a process can dwarf the contribution of individual workers' talent.\r\n2.

A toy problem is useful to test and demonstrate methodologies. Researchers can use toy problems to compare the performance of different algorithms. They are also good for game designing.\r\nFor instance, while engineering a large system, the large problem is often broken down into many smaller toy problems which have been well understood in detail. Often these problems distill a few important aspects of complicated problems so that they can be studied in isolation. Toy problems are thus often very useful in providing intuition about specific phenomena in more complicated problems.\r\nAs an example, in the field of artificial intelligence, classical puzzles, games and problems are often used as toy problems. These include sliding-block puzzles, N-Queens problem, missionaries and cannibals problem, tic-tac-toe, chess, Tower of Hanoi and others.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nBlocks world\r\nFiring squad synchronization problem\r\nMonkey and banana problem\r\nSecretary problem\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nExternal links\r\n\"toy problem\".

Toyota Connected is a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, founded in partnership with Microsoft, and is involved in research and the development of technology for in-vehicle services, telematics and other forms of artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nToyota Connected North America was officially established in April 2016 in Plano, Texas, where the U.S. headquarters of Toyota Motor North America were also hosted; the company's foundation was intended as an expansion of Toyota\u2019s partnership with Microsoft, which had originally begun in 2011 with the goal of building a platform for telematics services. As part of the venture, Microsoft had a 5 percent stake in Toyota Connected, and provided the company with access to their cloud-based platform Azure, in order to develop or expand wireless services suited to track driving patterns, share information on traffic and weather conditions and monitoring personal health data, among other functions. Toyota Connected also announced it would support research projects on artificial intelligence, while simultaneously focusing on the analysis of data from vehicle sensors and cameras to develop algorithms for self-driving cars.\r\nAt inception, Toyota invested an estimated $5.5 million in Toyota Connected; Zach Hicks, who had previously served as the chief digital officer at Toyota Motor North America, was appointed as the company\u2019s first CEO.\r\nIn July 2022, Hicks stepped down from his role as CEO and president of Toyota Connected following his retirement, being subsequently replaced by Steve Basra. In August 2023, former Toyota Connected Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Christopher Yang was appointed as the company's new CEO, after Basra had left both the role and the company in June of the same year.\r\nAt the 2023 New York International Auto Show, Toyota Connected debuted its proprietary generative artificial intelligence tool to produce photorealistic images through text input.\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Data universalism\r\nData universalism is an epistemological framework that assumes a single universal narrative of any dataset without any consideration of geographical borders and social contexts.

This assumption is enabled by a generalized approach in data collection. Data are used in universal endeavours across social, political, and physical sciences unrestricted from their local source and people. Data are gathered and transformed into a mutual understanding of knowing the world which forms theories of knowledge. One of many fields of critical data studies explores the geologies and histories of data by investigating data assemblages and tracing data lineage which unfolds data histories and geographies (p. 35). This reveals intersections of data politics, praxes, and powers at play which challenges data universalism as a misguided concept.\r\n\r\nTheoretical framework\r\nData are mainly sampled in rich Western countries which are considered the leaders and voices of technological developments while ignoring cultures, communities, and geographies despite its application being widespread. As the data lifecycle grows, processed small data that are grounded within big data are compiled and formed from heterogeneous sources extracted from mainstream places, forming what has come to be understood as knowledge.\r\nAs of 2022, research has not shown the origin behind universalism as a practice due to a lack of controlled data. According to cultural psychologists, democracy and universalism have a positive correlation but there are no studies that show how universalism is shaped by people's experiences and environments (p. 1). A push toward datafication has been spurred by democratically advanced Western voices and diffused across fragile democracies in the Global South with no consideration to the geopolitical context and influence powers of the data landscape in countries outside the West.  As mentioned by Cappelen et. al, obscure information is found on the epistemology of universalism, although it is argued that a lack of representative data are problematic for broad global analyses (p. 1).\r\n\r\nCriticism\r\nData universalism has been critiqued by many scholars concerned about data privacy and data justice, claiming that it conceals cultural specifications and diversity. Datafication ought to be viewed through the lens of epistemic diversity and justice to achieve data obedience. So, people are encouraged to critically examine the impacts of datafication by reimagining people and places.\r\n\r\nDe-westernization\r\nMilan and Trer\u00e9 have contended that datafication as a privileged practice carried by dominant Western democracies that fail to see the richness of worldviews and meanings of the South. As promoted by Global South and Indigenous scholars, data universalism mistakenly assumes data to be universal when it ought to be treated differently (p. 323). If data are extracted without an ethical foundation grounded by attitude and method, the data becomes pervasive and incompetent. Moreover, a shift from a technocentric perspective that emphasizes the human agency behind data to a data method that stimulate discussion about the repercussions of datafication requires relocating the agency. This reinforces the notions of ethics and responsibilities around the data (p. 327). A push for bottom-up data practices shifts the focus of datafication to data justice to encourage citizens of the South to participate in political agency and repel an oppressed and inequal datafication process. Negligence in abstracting knowledge from others through diversifying social and historical contexts will result in biased sampling techniques and methods in data generation. This causes skewed data to be generated leading to unequal datafication.\r\nAlso, an aggregate technique used for data processing misrepresents data in a way that shapes an aggregate value as representing an aggregated individual. This adheres to the bias factor in making the subject appear as a collective by reducing variance and limiting space of contributions (p. 192). Using an aggregate technique submits to universal normativity which situates what is considered to be universally right as a practice that does not take responsibility for the context of a specific situation nor the interpretation of norms. Similarly, the interpretation of norms are also subject to contextual interpretations. While humans operate in unique cases where information can be incomplete, agency empowers humans to assess the situation and make radical decisions in complex situations where information is obscure. Thus, assuming universal normativity will not only incapacitate one's ethical validity when making choices but may lead to questionable decisions (p. 284).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 194227, "end_char_idx": 199422, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56e026ff-ed4f-4527-87c1-631c6cb66072": {"__data__": {"id_": "56e026ff-ed4f-4527-87c1-631c6cb66072", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b034b7c6-7cda-4dfe-857f-085c60086ef8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "8c9e6ad35ab9e00b60a9dc1a813201c071309cda3a7bfbb31788d0ce97c30b40", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "653fd480-ee28-4e56-83f9-86915e23f434", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7cf75a67548e41777ca977bb1c3f873efbe94a218df9e02cd96057d3c1706000", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This causes skewed data to be generated leading to unequal datafication.\r\nAlso, an aggregate technique used for data processing misrepresents data in a way that shapes an aggregate value as representing an aggregated individual.

Colonialism, in this perspective, is understood as data colonialism which pressures but also exploits datafication on communities. Global South and Indigenous scholars claim that the decolonial lens which transcends to a Eurocentric perspective adds value to critical data studies by questioning the geopolitics of knowledge, the depth of knowledge regeneration, and the power constructions of past injustices. Notions of data politics and data justice are more interested in giving a voice to the underprivileged and acquiring decolonial practices rather than issues concerning the blueprints of the political and social contexts of liberal democracies and social orders. Still, achieving decolonial critical data studies comes with a unique set of challenges that confronts the knowledge that has been produced and the knowings of the world, which is at the center of epistemology. The wave of the big data revolution feeds on insights into the production of data, how knowledge is produced, and how it is conducted and governed while using new epistemologies to make sense of the world.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nBig data\r\nColonialism\r\nCritical data studies\r\nData\r\nGlobal South\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Ilkay Altintas\r\nIlkay Altintas is a Turkish-American data and computer scientist, and researcher in the domain of supercomputing and high-performance computing applications.

The WorDS hub at SDSC serves to promote the utilization and distribution of workflow services in the context of a variety of domains and projects, ranging from the WIFIRE lab (which Altintas founded and currently directs) to the Kepler scientific workflow system (which Altintas serves as the co-initiator of).\r\n\r\nWIFIRE Lab\r\nOn October 26, 2003, Altintas experienced California wildfires for the first time, after witnessing the Cedar Fire in San Diego County. The environmental and economic toll that this natural disaster had on the residents of San Diego County inspired Altintas to contribute to improving the then-current systems of managing and predicting wildfires. She allotted much of her time thereafter to learning about California's fire-adapted ecosystem, and the two factors, weather and fuel, that contribute significantly to the spread and dynamic behavior of wildfires. She noted that the behavior of wildfires can be computationally modeled, with data for modeling purposes being pulled from the physical environment (e.g., landscape data, real-time weather information and camera imagery, and remote sensor data). This spurred the creation of Altintas' brainchild, the WIFIRE lab, which received National Science Foundation (NSF) funding from 2013 to 2018. Using scalable computing and dynamic, automated, scientific workflows, data are collected and processed, and can be retrieved and accessed by a diverse array of audiences. The main accomplishments of the WIFIRE lab till date include the deployment of data integration services at the intersection of fire science, data management, and machine learning; real-time data driven fire modeling services (with the help of the High Performance Wireless Research and Education Network (HPWREN)); and automated fire modeling workflows and machine learning pipelines. The WIFIRE lab currently serves a community of 130+ organizations, and works to combine data science and fire science to aid in dynamic fire modeling at scale. Altintas has presented on past and ongoing WIFIRE research to a variety of audiences, ranging from stakeholders and policymakers at the California State Capitol to UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) Science Policy Fellows Program graduate students.\r\nThe real-time fire modeling services provided by the WIFIRE lab have aided in the identification and traceability of wildfire outbreaks in local California communities. In addition to aiding in the identification and traceability of wildfire outbreaks, the framework of the services deployed by WIFIRE is being used toward aiding in the identification and traceability of the COVID-19 outbreak. The application of the real-time map (used initially for wildfire identification) in the space of COVID-19 research serves the purpose of alerting individuals in real-time regarding information surrounding the spread and severity of the virus in certain areas.\r\nFor her pioneering WIFIRE work, Altintas has been featured on various US-based radio broadcasts, newspapers, and magazines. She has been featured on TIME magazine, the National Public Radio (NPR), The New York Times, and Voice of America, along with research scientists whom she has collaborated with. She has also been featured on the University of California Television (UCTV) channel for her WIFIRE research.\r\n\r\nThe Kepler Project\r\nAltintas is the co-initiator of the Kepler scientific workflow system, an open source platform that allows its users to share and collaborate on workflows for a variety of applications. The Kepler Project website provides its visitors with the opportunity to download the Kepler application. It also serves as a home for information regarding upcoming Kepler-related workshops, references on how to use Kepler for a varied set of subjects and applications (such as bioinformatics), and tips regarding how to maneuver the application in an effective manner.\r\n\r\nTeaching\r\nAltintas currently serves as the faculty co-director of the Master of Advanced Studies in Data Science and Engineering, and as a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, at UC San Diego.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 202315, "end_char_idx": 207349, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb502512-8e32-470b-beb9-75fd6cb5be41": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb502512-8e32-470b-beb9-75fd6cb5be41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "653fd480-ee28-4e56-83f9-86915e23f434", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "01ea2e559a6708bbc6ebcb306e67d87c896a5ea2d68fb2d905dc5a1ec75a74cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c9cfb25d-b605-4b53-abdf-724bbc57e88c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "efcde5cb8b99d9fe4b0ff1398ebb7202ff70e9b331e84db485f6fab98c25b780", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "She has also been featured on the University of California Television (UCTV) channel for her WIFIRE research.\r\n\r\nThe Kepler Project\r\nAltintas is the co-initiator of the Kepler scientific workflow system, an open source platform that allows its users to share and collaborate on workflows for a variety of applications.

He is the associate provost for artificial intelligence and professor of computer science at Touro University.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nShlomo Argamon received his B.S. in applied mathematics from Carnegie-Mellon University and his MPhil and Ph.D. in computer science from Yale University, supervised by Drew McDermott. He spent two years doing postdoctoral research under a Fulbright Foundation fellowship with Sarit Kraus at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel.\r\n\r\nResearch\r\nSince the late 1990s, Argamon has worked primarily on computational linguistics and machine learning, focusing on the analysis of non-denotational meaning, including computational analysis of language stylistics, sentiment analysis, and metaphor analysis. He has also published well-cited research on active learning (machine learning), metalearning, and robotic mapping.\r\n\r\nComputational stylistics\r\nArgamon is best known for his work on computational stylistics, particularly author profiling. Together with Moshe Koppel and others, he has shown how statistical analysis of word usage can determine an author's age, sex, native language, and personality type with high accuracy in English-language texts. His work also has shown how textual features indicating differences between male and female authorship are consistent between languages and across time.\r\nArgamon also developed computational stylistic methods that provide insights into the meaning of stylistic differences. One of his key innovations for this purpose is the development of computational stylistic analysis using systemic functional linguistics. For example, together with Jeff Dodick and Paul Chase, he examined whether there are clear and consistent differences between scientific method in experimental sciences and historical sciences. Their work showed how using systemic functional features in computational stylistic analysis provides evidence for multiple scientific methodologies of the sorts posited previously by philosophers of science.\r\n\r\nLinguistics for cybersecurity\r\nArgamon has pushed for the increased use of linguistic analysis for attribution of cybersecurity attacks. He has pointed out how linguistic attribution techniques can be used to good effect on natural language texts that arise in different attack scenarios, and has provided analyses for high-profile cases such as the Sony Pictures hack, the Democratic National Committee cyber attacks, and the Shadow Brokers NSA leak.\r\n\r\nData science\r\nIn 2013, Argamon founded the Illinois Institute of Technology Master of Data Science program, which he directed until 2019. The program seeks to teach students \"to think about the real problems that need to be solved, not to simply find technical solutions.\" Argamon views data scientists as \"sensemakers\", whose job is not merely to produce analytic results, but to help their clients make sense of a complex, uncertain, and fast-changing world through rigorous analysis and explanation of the data.\r\n\r\nHonors\r\nFellow of the British Computer Society.\r\nDistinguished Lecturer in Forensic Linguistics, Centre for Forensic Linguistics, Aston University, 2014.\r\nFulbright Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow, 1994\u20131996.\r\nHertz Foundation Doctoral Fellow, 1990\u20131994.\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Shaku Atre\r\nShakuntala \"Shaku\" Atre (1940 - 2024) is an Indian data scientist and an American business woman.

After a fourteen-year career with IBM, she began her own firm and became widely regarded as an expert on business technology and database use. Atre is best known for her books Database: Structured Techniques for Design, Performance and Management: With Case Studies (1980), one of the first books written on managing databases, and her co-authored book Business Intelligence Roadmap, written with Larissa Moss. She has served as an adjunct professor of data science at University of Pune and at several institutions in the United States. Her works have been used as university textbooks.\r\n\r\nEarly life and education\r\nAtre was born in 1940 in India into a Marathi family, and grew up in Panvel, a village near Mumbai. She earned a Master of Science from the University of Poona, studying mathematics and statistics. During her education, she also studied languages, gaining proficiency in speaking five different languages. Atre went on to begin her graduate studies in mathematics and physics at the University of Heidelberg, writing her thesis on astronomy. Because she needed to make large scale calculations to develop her thesis, she began studying computer programming, which led to an interest in the field of computer technology. During her studies, she was hired by IBM in 1967. When her student visa expired three and a half years later, Atre and her husband immigrated to the United States.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nWhen they arrived in New York City in 1971, IBM had implemented a hiring freeze, but Atre was able to convince them she was not a new hire because she had worked for the company in Germany. They put her on staff as a systems programmer and she worked for the company for the next ten years, moving up the ladder from installation and technical support, to trainer in IBM's Systems Institute, to branch office systems engineer and finally, as a program manager for international product releases. During her tenure at IBM, from 1977 to 1981, she served as one of the referees for the company\u2019s Systems Journal, selecting which articles would be peer-reviewed for the publication. In 1980, she published Data Base: Structured Techniques for Design, Performance, and Management with Case Studies, which would be used as a university textbook. It was translated into several different languages and had sold more than 150,000 copies within its first two decades of publication. During this period, she also began teaching as an adjunct professor at various universities, including the Polytechnic Institute of New York.\r\nIn the last quarter of 1981, Atre left IBM and began operating her own business consulting firm and working part-time managing long-distance telephone databases for AT&T. The following year, she began writing articles for Computerworld, which in 2003 would become a regular column for the magazine. Her book Data Base Management Systems for the Eighties was published in 1983, and provided a discussion of eight different data systems, comparing features and business applications to assist readers in analyzing which systems best met their needs. From 1984, her expert opinion of various data systems was regularly sought by trade magazines, such as Infosystems, MIS Week, Network World, and Software News, among others.\r\nIn 1988, Atre sold her firm, Atre International Consultants, of Rye, New York to Computer Assistance, Inc. of Hartford, Connecticut. She was retained as president of Atre International, which operated as a branch of Computer Assistance, and became a consultant to the fifteen other national branches of the firm. The firm was acquired by Coopers Lybrand in 1989 and the following year, she negotiated a joint-venture with Intec, Inc. a software firm from Mumbai to develop utilities and training programs for use with Windows 3. In 1991, Atre published Distributed Databases, Cooperative Processing, and Networking, which became the basis for a series of seminars of the same name, which she presented at the Technology Transfer Institute in 1992.

However, given that these ads were run both in swing (Plymouth) and non-swing constituencies (Oxford), the campaign may also have been intended for harvesting data on Green Party supporters. \r\nBorwick has also operated numerous other tech companies, including Disruptive Communications Ltd, which he started in partnership with Douglas Carswell, former UKIP MP; and Voter Consultancy Ltd, whose micro-targeting of Facebook Ads allegedly precipitated unforeseen death threats against Remainer MPs and led to a subsequent investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office.\r\nAssaulted by three women at a London KFC outlet in 2015, Borwick was critical of KFC's door security, who could assist only by escorting him and his girlfriend from the premises.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nBaron Borwick\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Nadieh Bremer\r\nNadieh Bremer is a data scientist and data visualization designer.

He also developed the Civic Data Cooperative, which resulted in the Combined Intelligence for Population Health Action (CIPHA) system during the pandemic. He is the recipient of HTN Health Tech Award, Alwyn-Smith Medal, and Florence Nightingale Award.\r\nBuchan is a Fellow of the Faculty of Public Health, the American College of Medical Informatics, British Computer Society and the Faculty of Clinical Informatics. He has also been an advisor to UK, European and international health policy groups, AstraZeneca) and research organizations including UKRI, Wellcome Trust and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), for which he is a Senior Investigator.\r\n\r\nEducation and early career\r\nIn the 1980s, Buchan pursued medical training alongside studies in pharmacology and statistical software development. As an undergraduate, he published the first version of a statistical package called \"StatsDirect.\" During the 1990s, as a junior doctor, he researched care pathways, health system dynamics, and care inequities. Later, he trained as a public health consultant while conducting research in medical informatics and pursuing doctoral studies in computational statistics.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nBuchan began his academic career in 1992 as an Honorary Clinical Lecturer at the University of Liverpool. He then served as a Research Associate in Medical Informatics at the University of Cambridge in 1996 and Senior Research Fellow in Medical Informatics at Wolfson College, Cambridge in 1997, before training as a Consultant in Public Health. In 2003, he joined the University of Manchester as a Clinical Senior Lecturer in Public Health Intelligence and was promoted in 2008 to Clinical Professor in Public Health Informatics. There, from 2003 to 2017, he founded Health eResearch Centre and co-directed the Farr Institute. In the E-Science movement of the early 2000s he conceived e-Labs and Research Objects, leading to today's Trusted Research Environments and applications in healthcare. At Manchester, he also invented the FARSITE system, helping spin out NW eHealth, and started the #DataSavesLives movement and the Connected Health Cities project.\r\nSubsequently, Buchan served as Director of Healthcare Research at Microsoft Research Cambridge in 2017\u20132018, producing two patents and furthering the health avatar framework he had conceived eight years earlier.\r\nIn 2018, Buchan returned to Liverpool as the University of Liverpool's first chair in Public Health and Clinical Informatics. From 2019 to 2022, he was the founding Executive Dean of the Institute of Population Health at Liverpool, whilst leading research responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2022, he has been conducting multidisciplinary research partnerships, especially in health technology as Associate Pro Vice Chancellor for Innovation.\r\n\r\nResearch\r\nBuchan's research areas encompass public health, data science, clinical informatics, epidemiology, and biostatistics. In particular, he has published in areas related to public health challenges, such as inequalities, obesity, mental health and pandemic resilience, and in methodology, including machine learning in epidemiology, research objects in e-science, learning health systems, and the concept of a digital twin/health avatar for healthcare.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 response and data-intensive public health research\r\nBuchan led the world's first evaluation of voluntary mass testing for the SARS-CoV2 antigen with lateral flow devices, working with the British Army, local and national government, public health agencies and the UK's National Health Service. This work provided quick proof that lateral flow devices worked as expected to detect people infected with the COVID-19 virus whether they had symptoms or not. Responding to media debate over the reliability of lateral flow devices, he clarified the evidence regarding a public health test versus a clinical test for COVID-19. The impact of this testing was that COVID-19 hospital admissions fell by 43% initially and 25% overall.

The BMJ asked him and colleagues for an accompanying methodology paper on the data analysis as a blueprint of best practice. The UK's universal access community testing policy was shaped by this work, including its demonstration of inequalities in testing uptake and barriers such as digital poverty. He had also formulated a test-to-release daily testing alternative to quarantine for close contacts of cases, which resulted in the Daily Contact Testing policy. He also researched COVID-19 and informed policies in other contexts including care homes, hospitals, schools, and vaccination.\r\nIn Spring 2021, Buchan applied previous testing and other COVID-19 risk mitigation research to address the issue of young people being vaccinated last and missing out on social development opportunities due to the continued lockdown of significant cultural events. So, he led a city-scale reopening (after COVID-19 lockdowns) of a cluster of business, nightclub and a music festival events \u2013 resulting in minimal SARS-CoV-2 transmission, high levels of enjoyment, low levels of fear over risks, and demonstrated the effectiveness of collaborative strategies for health security at mass cultural gatherings.\r\n\r\nPublic health and data science\r\nBuchan's research has underscored the importance of trust in health data utilization, highlighting transparency, consent, and public involvement, with a specific focus on the role of national governments in the reuse of health data. Building on earlier work in civic data linkage and public health intelligence, he established the first Civic Data Cooperative in Liverpool in late 2019, and put a National Grid of Civic Data Cooperatives forward to the UK Government as means of improving health system innovation and resilience.\r\nBuchan engaged machine learning researchers from Microsoft Research in the field of epidemiology, leading to discoveries pertaining to asthma and allergies. Most recently, he formed the Mental Health Research for Innovation Centre of the UK Government's Mental Health Mission.\r\nBuchan conducted research on other health data science directions including Trusted/Trustworthy Research Environments with Research Objects and eLab networks to improve research reproducibility and tackle the widespread problem of calibration drift in clinical prediction models. He drew attention to the problem of multimorbidity and the need for a unified modelling approach, not only for discovery science but also for personalized care via interactive Health Avatars.\r\nSome of Buchan's most highly cited papers arose from applications of his statistical software to public health problems. He has worked to make better use of routine health record data with combined biostatistics and machine learning approaches to predicting clinical outcomes.\r\nBuchan's data science research has focused on addressing public health challenges, including obesity, inequalities, mental health, and pandemics. He raised a warning over obesity among pre-school children using routinely collected data, then alerted to the high burden of cancer attributable to obesity, then highlighted the challenges of using consumer technology data to understand weight control. He drew attention to the excess of premature deaths in North compared with South England and the need for regional growth incentives.\r\n\r\nAwards and honors\r\n2012 \u2013 Fellow, American College of Medical Informatics\r\n2014 \u2013 Manchester Ambassador, Greater Manchester Combined Authority\r\n2017 \u2013 Fellow, British Computer Society\r\n2017 (renewed 2023) \u2013 Senior Investigator, National Institute for Health and Care Research\r\n2021 \u2013 Best Use of Health Data, HTN Health Tech Awards\r\n2022 \u2013 Healthcare Project of the Year, BioNoW\r\n2022 \u2013 Alwyn-Smith Medal, The Faculty of Public Health\r\n2023 \u2013 Florence Nightingale Award, Royal Statistical Society\r\n\r\nSelected articles\r\nBundred, P.; Kitchiner, D; Buchan, I (10 February 2001). \"Prevalence of overweight and obese children between 1989 and 1998: population based series of cross sectional studies\".

They developed a method of video analysis that produced dramatically more points of statistical data than contemporary methodologies.\r\nAfter John's hockey career was ended by injury, he identified the potential marketability of Chayka and Lane's method of video analysis, which eventually grew into the founding of Stathletes by the Chaykas and Lane in 2010. The company grew quickly and, in 2012, the Vancouver Canucks became the first National Hockey League (NHL) team to employ their services.\r\nChayka has used her position within the company to champion the growth of women's ice hockey and Stathletes has become an industry leader in analytics for the women's game. Statistical data and analysis generated by Stathletes were used by the CBC's for its broadcasts of the women's ice hockey tournament at the 2018 Winter Olympics and the women's ice hockey tournament at the 2022 Winter Olympics. Chayka spearheaded the landmark partnership between Stathletes and the National Women's Hockey League (PHF since 2021) to provide analytics for the 2020\u201321 NWHL season.\r\nA regular participant in academic conferences, she has spoken at a number of analytics and sports conferences, including at the 2020 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference and the inaugural Women's Hockey Analytics Conference.\r\nDuring the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, Chayka joined forces with Alison Lukan to present Hockey Analytics Night in Canada (HANIC), a regular online conference intended to bring together and spark discussion within the ice hockey analytics community via diverse topics and speakers.\r\n\r\nAwards and honours\r\nChayka was named the Ontario Chamber of Commerce's Top Young Entrepreneur of the Year in 2018.

She was born in Rockland County, New York. She is recognized for her contributions to the field of data science.\r\nChowdhury's journey into the world of science was inspired by her love for science fiction, a passion that ignited her curiosity, often attributed to the \"Dana Scully Effect.\" This fascination with the intersection of science and fiction laid the foundation for her future endeavors.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nChowdhury completed her undergraduate study in Management Science and Political Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She received a Master of Science from Columbia University in Statistics and Quantitative methods. She holds a Doctorate Degree in Political Science from University of California, San Diego. She finished her PhD whilst working in Silicon Valley. Her main interest for her career and higher educational studies was how data can be used to understand people's bias and ways to evaluate the impact of technology on humanity.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nEarly\r\nChowdhury taught data science at the boot camp Metis and worked at Quotient before joining Accenture in 2017. She led their work on responsible artificial intelligence. She was concerned about algorithmic bias and the AI workforce; particularly on retaining researchers. She has spoken openly about the need to define what ethical AI actually means and was responsible for coining the term \"moral outsourcing\".

META's goal was to study and improve the machine learning systems used within Twitter, this included biased algorithms which may cause harm to the user. Biased algorithms have been an issue for a long time in the tech industry; traits such as gender, sex, race, or social class hold potential segregation that may result in unfair decisions. META strived to avoid this by making Twitter better, fair, accountable, and more transparent for its users. Most projects that META teams worked on involved research and data analysis, and the team was largely made up of professors, researchers, and engineers. In 2021,  Chowdhury and the META team published an analysis titled Examining algorithmic amplification of political content on Twitter. In November 2022, Chowdhury was one of many Twitter employees who were laid off at short notice after Elon Musk's takeover of the company.\r\n\r\nAwards\r\nIn 2017, she was included in the 100 Women (BBC) in the \"Glass Ceiling Team\" category.

Flack is a data scientist, evolutionary biologist, and professor at the Santa Fe Institute.\r\n\r\nEducation and career\r\nJessica Flack attended Cornell University for her undergraduate studies and graduated in 1996 with a Bachelor of the Arts (Honors Degree). She received her PhD from Emory University in 2003, where she studied cognitive science, animal behavior and evolutionary theory. Following her Ph.D. she moved to the Santa Fe Institute as a postdoctoral fellow, and studied complexity science, collective behavior, and robustness from 2004 to 2007.\r\nIn 2011 she moved to the  University of Wisconsin, Madison to help found and direct the Center of Complexity & Collective Computation in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery. Following her work in Wisconsin, she went back to the Santa Fe Institute and, as of 2022, works there as a professor. Flack also acts as the director for the Collective Computation Group at SFI, and serves as the chair of public events. She performs much of her research in collaboration with co-director David Krakauer.\r\n\r\nResearch\r\nFlack is known for her work connecting the behavior of individuals to group activity. She has used animals, particularly macaques monkeys, to examine group behavior. Flack's early work examined social rules within chimpanzees.

Later in 1987, he obtained his M.S. from Cornell University, followed by a PHD from the same institution in 1988.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nGallego began his academic career at Columbia University in 1988, holding various positions within the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, promoted to full professor in 2000, and to the Liu Family Professorship in 2012. Additionally, from 2016 to 2022, he served as the Crown Worldwide Professor of Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Since 2022, he is the holder of the X.Q.

Gallego served as the department head of the Department of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology from 2016 to 2021. He currently serves as the Operations Research Area Coordinator in the School of Data Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.\r\n\r\nResearch\r\nGallego, in his early research, explored how companies could smoothly recover from production schedule disruptions, and on integrating inventory control and vehicle routing to optimize distribution systems. His 1993 collaborative work presented a new proof of Scarf's ordering rule for the newsboy problem and extended its analysis to scenarios in inventory management, including the recourse case, fixed ordering costs, random yields, and multi-item competition for scarce resources. In the following year, he proposed dynamic pricing strategies for inventory management in industries with time-constrained sales, stochastic and price-sensitive demand, using intensity control, obtaining structural monotonicity, closed-form solutions, and extensions to more complex scenarios. Moreover, in 1995, he addressed the optimization of pricing strategies for industries facing fixed stock and finite horizon challenges. The study determined the optimal timing of mark-ups or mark-downs based on stochastic demand and price sensitivity to maximize revenues.\r\nGallego's 1997 work proposed stochastic pricing strategies to optimize network revenue management problems, deriving asymptotic optimality results for simple policies. In 2001, he explored optimal inventory control policies, such as state-dependent (s, S) and base-stock policies, considering advance demand information, aiming to improve revenue, capacity use, and operational performance in stochastic inventory systems. In 2008, he explored the strategic use of callable products, analyzing their role in generating riskless additional revenue in the context of revenue management problems. Through this research, he also provided optimal pricing and booking strategies, with potential extensions to multifare structures, network models, and other industries.

Georgia Perakis from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in her review of the book said \"The book by Gallego and Topaloglu provides a fresh, up-to-date and in depth treatment of revenue management and pricing. It fills an important gap as it covers not only traditional revenue management topics but also new and important topics such as revenue management under customer choice as well as pricing under competition and online learning.\" She also lauded the book's ability to cater to a diverse range of readers, from advanced undergraduates to those pursuing masters and PhD degrees. In 2022, he presented a learning algorithm for a firm to optimize revenue through personalized pricing for various consumer types over a finite selling period, using a primal-dual formulation to explicitly learn the dual optimal solution and overcoming the curse of dimensionality.

He is also a member of NYU WIRELESS. Garg is known for his research leveraging machine learning to securely manufacture computer chips so they are less prone to hacking. In 2016, he was named one of Popular Science magazine's \"Brilliant 10.\"\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nGarg attended Indian Institute of Technology, Madras where he received his Bachelor of Technology degree in 2004. He then attended Stanford University for his Master of Science degree in electrical engineering 2005. For his doctoral research, he attended Carnegie Mellon University, where he received his PhD in 2009. His doctoral advisor was Diana Marculescu and his dissertation, entitled System-level modeling and mitigation of the impact of process variations on digital integrated circuits, received Carnegie Mellon's Angel G. Jordan Award for outstanding thesis contribution.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nFollowing Garg's postdoctoral work, he became an assistant professor at University of Waterloo from 2010 to 2014, before moving to New York University Tandon School of Engineering, where he is currently an associate professor. His research interests bridge machine learning and cybersecurity. His research group has investigated how artificial intelligence can be exploited by malicious actors. They found that it is possible to embed behavior in artificial intelligence algorithms, for example those used for speech recognition, that can emerge in response to certain signals. Garg and his team showed that they could train an image recognition algorithm to interpret a stop sign as a speed limit signal by placing a post-it note over it. When such behavior is programmed by malicious actors, it's known as a \"backdoor.\" They are working to understand different backdoors in order to develop ways to proactively detect them. Garg has also worked to develop manufacturing protocols for computer chips to make them resistant to hacking attempts.\r\n\r\nAwards and honors\r\nBrilliant 10, Popular Science, 2016\r\nNational Science Foundation CAREER Awards, 2015\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Karina Gibert\r\nKarina Gibert is a data scientist and researcher at the Technical University of Catalonia.

Furthermore, he has explored the philosophical foundations of Artificial Intelligence.\r\n\r\nComputer science\r\nGryz has worked primarily in the area of database query optimization. He proposed several techniques to improve query performance in relational databases using sampling, integrity constraints, views or a novel concept of soft constraints. Many of these algorithms have been implemented in the commercial version of DB2, IBM's relational database system. He further extended this work into other types of databases such as object-oriented, XML, and graph.\r\nIn the area of data mining, Gryz designed new algorithms for discovery of homogeneous regions in a binary matrix. He also worked on improving existing methods of frequent itemset mining. Furthermore, he branched into research on data visualization, which serves as a crucial element of analysis of massive data sets.[17].\r\n\r\nPhilosophy\r\nGryz's early research in philosophy focused on ethics. He examined the distinction between deontic and aretaic terms in moral vocabulary and offered a new interpretation of Stoic ethics. His interest in philosophy led to interdisciplinary research into philosophical foundations of AI, privacy in IT systems, and ethical issues, such as bias and interpretability of algorithms.\r\n\r\nAwards and honors\r\n2006 \u2013 Faculty Award, International Business Machines Corporation\r\n2010 \u2013 Outstanding Contribution to Internationalization Award, York International\r\n2016 \u2013 Senior Member, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)\r\n\r\nBibliography\r\nBooks\r\nDatabase Query Optimization with Soft Constraints (2008)\r\n\r\nSelected articles\r\nGryz, J.

She is a co-author of Dear Data, a collection of hand drawn data visualizations, along with information designer Stefanie Posavec. Her work is also part of the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art.\r\n\r\nEarly life and education\r\nLupi was born 1981 in Modena, Italy. When she was a little girl she would spend a significant amount of time collecting and organizing all kinds of items into folders: colored sheets of papers, tiny stones, pieces of textiles from her grandmothers buttons, sales receipts and so much more grew in her collection. She has said she took pleasure in organizing and categorizing her treasures based on their, sizes, color and dimensions. She has said that her childhood interest in numbers, cataloguing and classifying rules and systems explains the origin of her work and her desires to play with data. These interests have also included the scales of large cities and urban mapping projects, and representing information layers underlining an architecture project.\r\nShe graduated from FAF in Ferrara, Italy, where she studied architecture. Lupi has her masters in architecture, but has not built any houses during her schooling career. An architect's job is not to build buildings, but they design representations of buildings, images of building's following a system of symbols that convey information about how to manufacture them.  After graduating in 2006 She worked with two different interaction design firms in Italy, mostly working on interactive installations and mapping projects showing off difficult systems of knowledge. In 2011 she began her PhD in design at Milan Politecnico and started Accurat. In 2012 she moved to New York City where she lives now.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nIn 2011, Lupi co-founded research and design firm Accurat, that combines design and data to create data visualizations, interfaces, and tools.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 304177, "end_char_idx": 308945, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9004c52-5dcb-4599-8e8b-86c493f1b375": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9004c52-5dcb-4599-8e8b-86c493f1b375", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a1f1582-d028-4e56-9aee-5909eab84eb5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "d224639b18f58aa1e4cbf524d929b0ef00f36aa71905df01f8f35a2a665eb37d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e6176ca-0070-4ba4-9b2c-7cf2be2cd1bd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1de39ca6111aef9d1e746f008292973d0075f3488718646bfc0efa4235adf70a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "She graduated from FAF in Ferrara, Italy, where she studied architecture.

Among their clients are Google, IBM, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Starbucks, United Nations, the World Economic Forum and the Museum of Modern Art. Lupi's influences for her work come from fascinations by geometrical feel and balance of abstract art compositions. Lupi's work has been influenced by data visualization and data art by Moritz Stefaner, Aaron Koblin and Jer Thorp. What drives Lupi in her career is the overlapping space between intuition and analysis, between beauty and logic, numbers and images.\r\nIn 2014 Lupi began the Dear Data Project with Stefanie Posavec. Every week for one year Lupi and Posavec exchanged a \"data drawing\", a hand drawn data visualization that represented a part of their daily life, through the mail. In 2016 these postcards were compiled and published in a book called Dear Data. The following year the Museum of Modern Art added the original Dear Data postcards to the Museum's collection.\r\nIn 2016, Giorgia Lupi published an article in Print Mag in which she introduced the concept of Data Humanism, which she further developed in her TED Talk. \r\nIn 2019, Lupi joined Pentagram New York as a partner.\r\n\r\nLong Covid\r\nIn December 2023, she published her experience with Long Covid as a visual story in The New York Times.\r\n\r\nAwards\r\n2022: National Design Award by Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum\r\n2015: Information is Beautiful Awards - Gold Medal and Most Beautiful Project.\r\n2013: Information is Beautiful Awards - Gold Medal, category: Data Visualization.\r\n2013: Strata Conference - Data Journalism Award.\r\n2013: Cannes Festival - Bronze Lion, Direct Advertising.\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Nita Madhav\r\nNita Madhav is an epidemiologist and risk modeler who was CEO of Metabiota from 2019 - 2022.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nMadhav graduated from Yale University in 2002 with degrees in ecology and evolutionary biology, and received her Master's in Public health from Emory University in 2005.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nAfter time at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and AIR Worldwide, Madhav joined Metabiota to work on infectious disease modeling and data science.

Strolling Cities is the first project that \"unites generative AI, human voice, poetry and urban landscape.\" The neural network model was trained on \"millions of photos taken during the recent lockdowns (\u201920/\u201921) that show the urban space as an unfiltered landscape of walls, streets, and buildings.\" One of the main characteristics of this project is that Italian cities appear empty, without their population. The project makes it possible to \"manipulate the urban landscape with the voice, using any kind of vocal input, from simple utterances to more complex phrases.\" The video installations used in the exhibit featured 9 Italian cities: Bergamo, Bologna, Catania, Como, Florence, Genoa, Milan, Palermo, Rome and Venice. The authors whose poems appeared in the installation included Alda Merini, Giulia Niccolai, Stefano Benni, Giorgio Caproni, Cesare Pavese, Goffredo Parise, and Valerio Magrelli.\r\n150 Years of Nature is a data visualization project created in collaboration with Barab\u00e1si Lab and dedicated to the 150th Anniversary of Nature.  It includes an interactive tool, \"data movie\" and the cover showing the co-citation network of Nature publications throughout its history. 150 Years of Nature was the Webby Award Winner in 2020; it was awarded the Best Data Design at Fast Company - Innovation by Design Awards.

As of 2024, Megler is a principal data scientist at Amazon.com, and is known as the co-developer of The Hobbit, a 1982 text adventure game adapted from the novel by J. R. R. Tolkien.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nMegler was born in 1960, and educated in Melbourne at Mac.Robertson Girls' High School, where she was school valedictorian in science. She began studying science at the University of Melbourne, intending to major in statistics but switching to a computer science major which she found more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nBeam Software\r\nMegler became the first employee at video game development studio Beam Software/Melbourne House as a programmer. She recruited Philip Mitchell and the two began working on an illustrated interactive fiction game based on The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, with Megler concentrating on the game's physics system and a measure of autonomy for non-player characters.\r\nThis game was structured to be used as the basis for other games as an early adaptable game engine. The game was released in 1982 in the UK and Australia.\r\nMegler and Mitchell also developed another Beam game, Penetrator, also released in 1982.\r\n\r\nComputer science career\r\nPrior to her graduation from the University of Melbourne, Megler resigned from Beam to concentrate on her studies, and Mitchell remained to complete the ZX Spectrum version.

His work deals with human decisions in interactions with intelligent systems and he is a fellow of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.\r\n\r\nEarly life and education\r\nJoachim Meyer was born in M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr, Germany. He emigrated to Israel in 1973, completed high school at the Kanot agricultural school, did IDF service and was discharged  as a lieutenant.\r\nMeyer began his academic studies in the Department of Behavioral Sciences at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in 1979 and received his B.A. in 1982 (with honors), and M.Sc. in Psychology in 1986 (with honors). He then moved to the  Department of Industrial Engineering and Management at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev where he completed his Ph.D. in 1994. His dissertation on Processing of graphic displays that present quantitative information was supervised by David Shinar and David Leiser.\r\n\r\nAcademic career\r\nMeyer was a research fellow at the Faculty of Industrial Engineering at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology from 1993 until 1997. In 1995 he joined Ben-Gurion University of the Negev as a lecturer in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management and the School of Management. He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1998, to associate professor in 2003, and to full professor in 2009.\r\nIn 2012, Meyer joined the Department of Industrial Engineering at Tel Aviv University as a professor and was chair of the department from 2015 until 2019.\r\nMeyer held visiting academic positions at other universities and research institutes, including Harvard Business School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he was a Research Scientist at the Center for Transportation Studies (1999-2001) and helped to establish the MIT AgeLab. He was also a visiting professor at the Human Dynamics Group at the MIT Media Lab (2014-2015).\r\nMeyer has supervised more than 75 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.\r\n\r\nResearch\r\nMeyer\u2019s work focuses on modeling human decisions when interacting with intelligent systems. He combines methods and tools from psychology, economics, management science, and engineering, focusing on the development of models for predicting human decision making as a function of properties of the system, the situation, and the user. Applications are in various fields, including transportation, medicine, cyber security, privacy and management.\r\nMeyer\u2019s initial research dealt with the visualization of information, demonstrating that the relative advantage of different forms of visualization depends on multiple factors and in particular on the structure of the displayed information.\r\nMuch of Meyer\u2019s research deals with aided decision making and specifically the effects of alarms, alerts and binary cues on decisions. He demonstrated that there are two different types of trust in these systems \u2013 compliance, and reliance. He also studies the active role people have in shaping the information they use for decision making, including the adjustment of thresholds of alerts, which tends to be incorrect and may even be practically impossible, because users don't have the necessary information.\r\nIn recent years he developed, together with his student Nir Douer, the ResQu (Responsibility Quantification) model of human responsibility, which is a method to quantify the responsibility of a human operator when using a system with advanced automation for tasks such as medical diagnostics,  the identification of cyber-attacks, or the operation of advanced weapon systems. He has also studied behavioral aspects of cyber security, demonstrating that cyber risk taking is the combination of three behaviors (the Triad of Risk Related Behaviors), and developing models of different aspects of cyber security, such as the question when users\u2019 actions should be blocked and when they should be warned.\r\nProf. Meyer has authored more than 170 scientific publications.\r\n\r\nProfessional experience\r\nMeyer was the chairperson of the Israeli Society for Human Factors Engineering and Ergonomics during 2005-2008.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 322555, "end_char_idx": 327264, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cdcee25a-1007-4440-910a-50977c331504": {"__data__": {"id_": "cdcee25a-1007-4440-910a-50977c331504", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b969e55b-8ffa-476c-bc19-2cc510ed1fba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "84ffc5cea6d2738a6792eaea39fe8f7638f68d75a5554b107a4e2a2ed36060c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "081b8c2b-8f2b-4ef5-8965-4d51c4ede6f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3ef9052904e2116f5ad84902adaa84cf4be20a4b9987cc38f9564166522e86b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In recent years he developed, together with his student Nir Douer, the ResQu (Responsibility Quantification) model of human responsibility, which is a method to quantify the responsibility of a human operator when using a system with advanced automation for tasks such as medical diagnostics,  the identification of cyber-attacks, or the operation of advanced weapon systems.

The current leadership team consists of Averi Giudicessi, Athanasia Monika Mowinckel, Shannon Pileggi, Riva Quiroga  and Yanina Bellini Saibene. The leadership team has an overarching role in steering and directing the organization. It works closely together with more than 20 volunteers who take care of various areas such as campaigns, the directory, mentoring, public communications and social media, or the community Slack. As of 2024, the R-Ladies Global community consists of 219 groups in 63 countries.\r\n\r\nOrganization\r\nR-Ladies meetings are organized around workshops and talks, led by people that identify as female or as gender minorities (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender, pangender, two-spirt, gender-fluid, neutrois). The organization is coordinated by the Global Team. The chapters, however, operate decentralized and new chapters can be founded by anyone using the publicly available \"starter-kit\".\r\nR-Ladies groups aim to promote a culture of inclusion within their events and community. In addition, they promote gender equality and diversity in conferences, in the workplace, collaboration among gender minorities, and analysis of data about women.\r\nThe Directory is a public directory listing 1,267 profiles of R-Ladies (in 2024). R-Ladies Global also showcases blogs written and maintained by their members. \r\nR-Ladies also collaborates with other projects, such as NASA Datanauts or PyLadies.\r\n\r\nGabriela de Queiroz\r\nGabriela de Queiroz is the Director of AI at Microsoft and the founder of first R-Ladies chapter, AI Inclusive and co-founder of R-Ladies Global. Before, she also worked at IBM as a chief data scientist.\r\n\r\nEarly life and education\r\nShe was raised in Brazil and received her bachelor's degree in statistics from Rio de Janeiro State University. She has a master\u2019s in epidemiology at Oswaldo Cruz Foundation and another one in statistics at California State University, East Bay. de Queiroz moved to the United States in 2012 to begin her master's degree in statistics at California State University, East Bay.\r\n\r\nAchievements\r\nInterested in creating an inclusive space for women learning the programming language R, she began a Meetup group in the San Francisco Bay area. Since then, the R-Ladies organization has grown to 219 groups in 63 countries.\r\nIn addition to her work with R-Ladies, de Queiroz is an expert in machine learning and led IBM's AI Strategy and Innovations team. Her team contributed to projects such as TensorFlow. de Queiroz was a finalist of the Women in Open Source Award by Red Hat in 2019, named 40 under 40 by CSUEB as well as listed among the 100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics\u2122 in 2023.\r\n\r\nNotable members\r\nJulia Stewart Lowndes \u2013 Marine ecologist\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Karthik Ram\r\nKarthik Ram is a research scientist at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and member of the Initiative for Global Change Biology at the University of California, Berkeley.

Rich died about an hour and a half after being shot twice in the back. The perpetrators were never apprehended; police suspected he had been the victim of an attempted robbery.\r\nThe 27-year-old Rich was an employee of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and his murder spawned several right-wing conspiracy theories, including the false claim, contradicted by the law enforcement branches that investigated the murder, that Rich had been involved with the leaked DNC emails in 2016. It was also contradicted by the July 2018 indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence agents for hacking the e-mail accounts and networks of Democratic Party officials and by the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion the leaked DNC emails were part of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Fact-checking websites like PolitiFact, Snopes, and FactCheck.org stated that the theories were false and unfounded. The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post wrote that the promotion of these conspiracy theories was an example of fake news.\r\nRich's family denounced the conspiracy theorists and said that those individuals were exploiting their son's death for political gain, and their spokesperson called the conspiracy theorists \"disgusting sociopaths\". They requested a retraction and apology from Fox News after the network promoted the conspiracy theory, and sent a cease and desist letter to the investigator Fox News used. The investigator stated that he had no evidence to back up the claims which Fox News attributed to him. Fox News issued a retraction, but did not apologize or publicly explain what went wrong. In response, the Rich family sued Fox News in March 2018 for having engaged in \"extreme and outrageous conduct\" by fabricating the story defaming their son and thereby intentionally inflicting emotional distress on them. Fox News reached a seven-figure settlement with the Rich family in October 2020.\r\n\r\nSeth Rich\r\nEarly life and career\r\nRich grew up in a Jewish family in Omaha, Nebraska. He volunteered for the Nebraska Democratic Party, interned for Senator Ben Nelson, was active in Jewish outreach, and worked with the United States Census Bureau. In 2011, he graduated from Creighton University with a degree in political science. He moved to Washington, D.C., to work for pollster Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. In 2014, he began working for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) as the voter expansion data director.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 344258, "end_char_idx": 348932, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9752c5c9-d466-4599-a18b-49a2a69702cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "9752c5c9-d466-4599-a18b-49a2a69702cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2de2fb7a-fbd1-4d71-adb3-d77eceb1171e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "ad7b031b4010b000c8f0114695a9cdb2922ef3e49cbc34656c374ceed4926b3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "953c088e-b0bd-4d68-96e9-fed2ec753ef5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fbc4e4ac8f8f12a3c0490081a1c44483e162058c745820294e2e9c59b82b3262", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Fox News issued a retraction, but did not apologize or publicly explain what went wrong.

In 2011, he graduated from Creighton University with a degree in political science. He moved to Washington, D.C., to work for pollster Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. In 2014, he began working for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) as the voter expansion data director. One of his tasks at the DNC was the development of a computer application to help voters locate polling stations.\r\n\r\nShooting and death\r\nOn Sunday, July 10, 2016, at 4:20 a.m., Rich was shot about a block from his apartment at the southwest corner of Flagler Place and W Street Northwest in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington, D.C.\r\nEarlier that night, he had been at Lou's City Bar, a sports pub 1.8 miles (2.9 km) from his apartment, in Columbia Heights, where he was a regular customer. He left when the bar was closing, at about 1:30 or 1:45 a.m. Police were alerted to gunfire at 4:20 a.m. by an automated gunfire locator. Less than one minute after the gunfire, police officers found Rich conscious with gunshot wounds. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died over 1+1\u20442 hours after being shot. That he was not shot in the head is seen as evidence against the shooting having been an \"assassination\". According to police, he died from two shots to the back and may have been killed in an attempted robbery. Residents noted the neighborhood had been plagued by robberies.\r\nRich's mother told NBC's Washington affiliate WRC-TV: \"There had been a struggle. His hands were bruised, his knees are bruised, his face is bruised, and yet he had two shots to his back, and yet they never took anything ... They didn't finish robbing him, they just took his life.\" The police told the family they had found a surveillance recording showing a glimpse of the legs of two people who could be the killers.\r\n\r\nAftermath\r\nOn the day after the shooting, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued a statement mourning his loss and praising Rich's work to support voter rights. Two days after the shooting, Hillary Clinton spoke of his death during a speech advocating limiting the availability of guns.\r\n\r\nIn September 2016, Rich's parents and girlfriend appeared on the syndicated television show Crime Watch Daily to speak about the murder case. In October 2016, a plaque and bike rack outside the DNC headquarters were dedicated to Rich's memory. In February 2017, the Beth El Synagogue in Omaha named after Rich an existing scholarship that helps Jewish children attend summer camps.\r\nThe Rich family accepted the pro bono public relations services of Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman in September 2016. The Rich family and Burkman held a joint press conference on the murder in November 2016. In January 2017, Burkman launched an advertising campaign in Northwest D.C. searching for information regarding Seth's death. This included billboard advertisements and canvassing with flyers. In late February, Burkman told media outlets he had a lead that the Russian government was involved in Rich's death, and the Rich family then distanced itself from Burkman. On March 19, 2017, Rich's brother, Aaron, started a GoFundMe campaign to try to raise $200,000 for private investigation, public outreach activities, and a reward fund.\r\nThe Rich family was approached by Ed Butowsky (a friend of Trump advisor Steve Bannon and a frequent Fox News contributor), who recommended having Fox News contributor and former homicide detective Rod Wheeler investigate Seth's murder. Butowsky said Wheeler had been recommended to him. The family gave Wheeler permission to investigate, though they did not hire him. When questioned by CNN, Butowsky denied involvement in the case, but later admitted he was involved and had offered to pay Wheeler's fees.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 348021, "end_char_idx": 352380, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "953c088e-b0bd-4d68-96e9-fed2ec753ef5": {"__data__": {"id_": "953c088e-b0bd-4d68-96e9-fed2ec753ef5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9752c5c9-d466-4599-a18b-49a2a69702cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "5d9739be5b6d4727cd1bb20a94e80282f0924204abc8d2551e26aaa8ec81c7ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c74235a8-ec08-4f10-b4b6-eb06c2dd97b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "324427e983a789d2860328630ba4d866c1ca32bad27f69b455651fc9e335fa8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This included billboard advertisements and canvassing with flyers.

After Wheeler asserted links between Rich and Wikileaks in a Fox affiliate interview on May 15, 2017\u2014an assertion he later backpedaled from\u2014the family spokesman said that the family regretted working with Wheeler. Wheeler then sued Fox News on August 1, 2017, for mental anguish and emotional distress, alleging that he had been misquoted in a story that was then published on the urging of Trump.\r\n\r\nRewards\r\nThe Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) posted its customary reward of $25,000 for information about the death.\r\nOn August 9, 2016, WikiLeaks announced a $20,000 reward for information about Rich's murder leading to a conviction. Rich's family said they were unable to verify this reward offer. WikiLeaks stated that this offer should not be taken as implying Rich had been involved in leaking information to it.\r\nIn November 2016, Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman said he was personally offering a $100,000 reward in addition to those announced by the police department and WikiLeaks, and he added another $5,000 to his offer in December and another $25,000 in January. Burkman said he hoped the money would help \"get to the truth of what happened here and will either debunk the conspiracy theories or validate them.\"\r\n\r\nConspiracy theories\r\nOrigins\r\nBeginnings on social media\r\nPolitical conspiracy theories and racially charged comments started to appear on social media the day after Rich's death. Within days, right-wing conspiracy theories began circulating, including false claims that his murder was connected to the DNC email leak of 2016 or the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation.\r\nA post on Twitter before Rich's memorial service spread the idea that his killing was a political assassination. Subsequently, the conspiracy theory was spread on the subreddit /r/The Donald, and on July 29, 2016, the website Heat Street reported on these Reddit posts. Reddit users attempted to tie the homicide to the Clinton body count conspiracy theory. The conspiracy theory was later popularized by Donald Trump political adviser Roger Stone via his Twitter account.\r\nAccording to British journalist Duncan Campbell, the Russian intelligence agency, GRU, tried to implicate Rich as the source of the stolen DNC emails in order to draw attention away from themselves as the real perpetrators of the theft. Datestamps on the DNC files were altered to show the data had been obtained on July 5, 2016, five days before Rich's death, and the time zone was changed to Eastern Time, within which Washington, D.C., falls. Guccifer 2.0, the alleged GRU front that provided the emails to Wikileaks, then reported that Rich had been their source. Based partly on their acceptance of the false dates, some experts then concluded that the emails had been copied in the DNC offices, and had not been hacked from outside.\r\n\r\nWikiLeaks statements\r\nJulian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, fueled the speculation in an interview with Nieuwsuur published on August 9, 2016, which touched on the topic of risks faced by WikiLeaks' sources. Unbidden, Assange brought up the case of Seth Rich. When asked directly whether Rich was a source, Assange said \"we don't comment on who our sources are\". Subsequent statements by WikiLeaks emphasized that the organization was not naming Rich as a source.\r\nAccording to the Mueller Report, WikiLeaks had received an email containing an encrypted file named \"wk dnc link I .txt.gpg\" from the Guccifer 2.0 GRU persona on July 14, which was four days after Seth Rich died.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 351463, "end_char_idx": 355922, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c74235a8-ec08-4f10-b4b6-eb06c2dd97b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c74235a8-ec08-4f10-b4b6-eb06c2dd97b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "953c088e-b0bd-4d68-96e9-fed2ec753ef5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "97574b3a9160e186d9aa3117edd0a40f9579747a974b195b7fc812d2dcbe3121", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "00af1618-c30a-4c95-83cc-e01e118e0a9f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c794d75c92fbc5473a0ae4122ee877639cf582bf182fa4e14265e29c3fe7d368", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Based partly on their acceptance of the false dates, some experts then concluded that the emails had been copied in the DNC offices, and had not been hacked from outside.\r\n\r\nWikiLeaks statements\r\nJulian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, fueled the speculation in an interview with Nieuwsuur published on August 9, 2016, which touched on the topic of risks faced by WikiLeaks' sources.

In April 2018, Twitter direct messages revealed that even as Assange was suggesting publicly that WikiLeaks had obtained emails from Seth Rich, Assange was trying to obtain more emails from Guccifer 2.0, who was at the time already suspected of being linked to Russian intelligence. BuzzFeed described the messages as \"the starkest proof yet that Assange knew a likely Russian government hacker had the Democrat leaks he wanted. And they reveal the deliberate bad faith with which Assange fed the groundless claims that Rich was his source, even as he knew the documents' origin.\" Mike Gottlieb, a lawyer for Rich's brother, noted that WikiLeaks received the file of stolen documents from the Russian hackers on July 14, four days after Rich was shot. Gottlieb described the chronology as \"damning\".\r\n\r\nJulian Assange not only knew that a murdered Democratic National Committee staffer wasn't his source for thousands of hacked party emails, he was in active contact with his real sources in Russia's GRU months after Seth Rich's death. At the same time he was publicly working to shift blame onto the slain staffer \u201cto obscure the source of the materials he was releasing,\u201d  Special Counsel Robert Mueller asserts in his final report on Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election.\r\n\r\nPropagation by right-wing media and venues\r\nThe conspiracy theories were promoted by Mike Cernovich, Sean Hannity, Geraldo Rivera, Kim Dotcom, Paul Joseph Watson, Newt Gingrich, Jack Posobiec, Tim Pool, and others.\r\nThe same venues that fomented the false Pizzagate conspiracy theory helped to promulgate the Seth Rich murder conspiracy theories, and each shared similar features. Both were promoted by individuals subscribing to far-right politics, and by campaign officials and individuals appointed to senior-level national security roles by Donald Trump. After prior coordination on Facebook, each theory was spread on Twitter by automated bots using a branded hashtag, with the goal of becoming a trending topic. Both the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and the Seth Rich murder conspiracy theory were spread in the subreddit forum /r/The_Donald. In both conspiracy theories, the promoters attempted to shift the burden of proof \u2014 asking others to attempt to disprove their claims, without citing substantiated evidence. Slate's Elliot Hannon called the claims about Seth Rich a \"PizzaGate-like conspiracy theory surrounding Rich's death\", The Huffington Post described it as \"the 'alt-right' idiocy of Pizzagate all over again\", NPR's David Folkenflik said Fox News coverage of it \"evokes the pizza-gate terrible allegations utterly unfounded\", and Margaret Sullivan wrote for The Washington Post: \"The Seth Rich lie has become the new Comet Ping Pong ... Crazy, baseless and dangerous.\"\r\nOn July 9, 2019, a Yahoo! News article stated that an alleged Russian Foreign Intelligence Service bulletin dated July 13, 2016 was the original source of the conspiracy theory.

A spokesman for the Washington, D.C., mayor's office, who said, \"All claims made by Mr. Wheeler are false and take fake news to a whole new level. The family deserves better and everyday MPD continues to work diligently to solve this case.\"\r\nPeople who worked with Rich said he didn't have access to the emails on the DNC server and was not an expert computer hacker helping to leak information to foreigners. Andrew Therriault, a data scientist who had mentored Rich, said although he had recently been working as a programmer, he did not have a programming background; another co-worker said Rich was very upset when he heard hackers associated with Russian intelligence services had broken into the DNC computers and could be interfering with the election. \r\nConspiracy theories falsely claimed that the FBI was investigating the case; in fact, the DC's MPD investigated the murder, and the FBI was not involved.\r\nNewt Gingrich promoted the conspiracy theory of a tie between Rich and Wikileaks, claiming that Rich \"apparently was assassinated\" subsequent to \"having given WikiLeaks something like ... 53,000 [DNC] emails and 17,000 attachments\". No evidence supported Gingrich's false and baseless claim, and there was no evidence of any link between Rich and Wikileaks.\r\nThe fabrications were described as fake news and falsehoods by The New York Times. The New York Times cited the conspiracy theories as an example of the persistence of false claims, concluding: \"fake news dies hard\". The Los Angeles Times called the conspiracy theories \"unsubstantiated rumors\".\r\nThe Washington Post cited the conspiracy theories as an example of the power of fake news to spread virally online. The paper used the example as a case study of the persistence of fake news, and found that television news media can be a soft target for such false stories. The Washington Post further found that the proliferation of fake news via Facebook had decreased, but remained powerful on Twitter due to spread via online bots. They found that the conspiracy theories with the largest potential to spread on the Internet were those that held attraction for both the alt-right movements and the political left wing. The Washington Post concluded that even if a particular false story had been sufficiently debunked, such fact-checking was unable to stop the spread of the falsehoods online.\r\n\r\nRetracted reporting\r\nUncorroborated Fox News story\r\nOn May 15, 2017, Fox 5 DC (WTTG) reported the uncorroborated and later largely retracted claims by Rod Wheeler, a Fox News contributor and former homicide detective, that there was evidence Seth Rich had contacted WikiLeaks and that law enforcement were covering this up, claims that were never independently verified by Fox. The next day, Fox News published a lead story on its website and provided extensive coverage on its cable news channel about what it later said were Wheeler's uncorroborated claims about the murder of Seth Rich; in the lead story Fox News removed from their website a few days later, they stated that Wheeler's claims had been \"corroborated by a federal investigator who spoke to Fox News.\" In reporting these claims, the Fox News report re-ignited conspiracy theories about the killing. According to NPR, within a day of the original Fox report, \"Google searches for Rich had overtaken searches for James Comey, even amid continuous news about the former FBI director's conversations with Trump.\" The Washington Post's Callum Borchers noted Fox News chose to lead with this story at a time when most other media outlets were covering Donald Trump's disclosure of classified information to Russia.\r\nOther news organizations revealed Wheeler was a Donald Trump supporter, a paid Fox News contributor, and according to NBC News had \"developed a reputation for making outlandish claims, such as one appearance on Fox News in 2007 in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol-toting lesbian gangs were raping young women\".", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 358882, "end_char_idx": 363715, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9a3222a-2f6a-4854-bd1c-9e40e9a2d13c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9a3222a-2f6a-4854-bd1c-9e40e9a2d13c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "00af1618-c30a-4c95-83cc-e01e118e0a9f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "1a42731cee2a1ce78bf30b8b62a27d6472ed4a20063d1fd499e0891e0ac5d1ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b44a10e7-1b3f-46ea-9fd4-8b6bd7c4da9b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d8719840444e577022dd1bffed8a921de6ad5313d40e36cbf7b39334572c283", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In reporting these claims, the Fox News report re-ignited conspiracy theories about the killing.

The Washington Post noted it is \"rare for a news organization to have such a close relationship with the people it is covering\", as Wheeler was \"playing three roles at once: as a Fox source, as a paid contributor to the network and as a supposedly independent investigator of the murder\". When Wheeler appeared on Sean Hannity's Fox News shows, these multiple roles were not disclosed to viewers. After Wheeler's Fox News interview on May 15, 2017, Brad Bauman, a communications professional and spokesman for the Rich family, said the family was asking Fox News and the Fox affiliate to retract their reports and apologize for damaging their son's legacy.\r\nThe family spokesperson, the Washington, D.C., police department, the Washington, D.C., mayor's office, the FBI, and law enforcement sources familiar with the case all disputed Wheeler's claims. The family said, \"We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers.\" Bauman criticized Fox News for its reporting, saying he believed that the outlet was motivated by a desire to deflect attention from the Trump-Russia story: \"I think there's a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda.\"\r\nLater that day, Wheeler told CNN he had no evidence that Rich had contacted Wikileaks. Wheeler claimed that Fox had presented his quotes misleadingly and that he only learned about the possible existence of the evidence from a Fox News reporter. Despite this, Sean Hannity's show and Fox & Friends continued to promote the conspiracy theory for the remainder of the week. On May 18, 2016, Hannity's guest on the show was Jay Sekulow who said that Rich's killing \"... undercuts this whole Russia argument;\" neither one mentioned that Sekulow had just been hired as one of Trump's lead lawyers in the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Geraldo Rivera took part in spreading the conspiracy. Hannity had on his program Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch, who said the organization filed Freedom of Information Act requests for documents from Washington, D.C., mayor Muriel E. Bowser, and from the Metropolitan Police. Sean Hannity furthermore promoted the uncorroborated claims of Kim Dotcom, a New Zealand resident sought by the United States on fraud charges who claimed without evidence that Rich had been in contact with him before his death. Fox News host Julie Roginsky was critical of the conspiracy theory peddlers, stating on Twitter and on her television show: \"The exploitation of a dead man whose family has begged conspiracy theorists to stop is really egregious. Please stop.\" Fox News was also criticized by conservative outlets, such as the Weekly Standard, National Review, and conservative columnists, such as Jennifer Rubin, Michael Gerson, and John Podhoretz. In September 2017, NPR noted that Fox News had yet to apologize for its false story or explain what went wrong; \"When a story of this scale crumbles, most news organizations feel obligated to explain what happened and why.

Despite this, Hannity, who pushed the theory, remained unapologetic, saying \"I retracted nothing\" and \"I am not going to stop trying to find the truth.\" In their May 23 statement, Fox News said, \"The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.\" Media ethics writer Kelly McBride criticized the retraction as \"woefully inadequate\", writing that it did not specify exactly what was inaccurate or provide correct information in place of the retracted story.\r\nThe same day, Hannity stated on his show that he would cease discussing the issue. Hannity said his decision to cease commenting on the matter was related to the family of the murder victim: \"Out of respect for the family's wishes, for now, I am not discussing the matter at this time.\" In the same statement wherein he promised to cease discussion of the topic, he vowed to pursue facts in the future: \"I promise you I am not going to stop trying to find the truth.\" Several advertisers including Crowne Plaza Hotels, Cars.com, Leesa Mattress, USAA, Peloton and Casper Sleep pulled their marketing from his program on Fox News. Crowne Plaza Hotels later said that it was not their policy to advertise on political commentary shows and that they had not been aware of their sponsorship of the show. USAA soon returned to advertising on Fox News after receiving customer input.\r\n\r\nInfoWars retraction\r\nIn 2019, Jerome Corsi and InfoWars apologized and retracted a story promoting conspiracy theories about the murder of Seth Rich. The retraction was published on the front page of InfoWars, where Corsi said that \"his allegations were not based upon any independent factual knowledge.\" Corsi said that he retracted the story because it relied on information that the Washington Times had retracted, but still thought that investigators should look into whether Seth Rich played a role.\r\n\r\nWheeler lawsuit\r\nOn August 1, 2017, Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Butowsky who was the first to claim links between Seth Rich's murder and the DNC hack on Fox, but who later appeared to retract his claims, filed a lawsuit (Case 1:17-cv-05807 Southern District of New York) in which 21st Century Fox, the Fox News Channel, Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman and Ed Butowsky were named as defendants, stating that quotes attributed to him in the original Fox News piece were fabricated. The lawsuit also alleged that the fabricated quotes were included in the Fox News story at the urging of the Trump White House.\r\nText messages and audio apparently supporting this assertion were included in the filing of the lawsuit. About a month before the story was aired on Fox News, Wheeler and Butowsky met at the White House with the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, to review the planned story on Seth Rich's murder. After talking to Wheeler and Butowsky, Zimmerman sent Wheeler a draft of a story without any quotes from Wheeler on May 11. On May 14, Butowsky texted Wheeler saying \"Not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article. He wants the article out immediately. It's now all up to you. But don't feel the pressure.\" Butowsky also left a voicemail for Wheeler which said \"We have the full, uh, attention of the White House on this. And tomorrow, let's close this deal, whatever we've got to do.\"\r\nButowsky said Seymour Hersh confirmed a link between Rich and the FBI.

Hersh confirmed the conversation with Butowsky but told NPR the link was \"gossip\" and that Butowsky exaggerated its significance.\r\nIn an email to Fox News, Butowsky also wrote about the purpose behind the Seth Rich story: \"One of the big conclusions we need to draw from this is that the Russians did not hack our computer systems and ste[a]l emails and there was no collusion (between) Trump and the Russians.\" He also instructed Wheeler that \"[T]he narrative in the interviews you might use is that you and [Zimmerman's] work prove that the Russians didn't hack into the DNC and steal the emails and impact our elections ... If you can, try to highlight this puts the Russian hacking story to rest.\"\r\nWhen the story aired on Fox News, it included supposed quotes from Wheeler and was written as if the accusations against the DNC came from him. Wheeler alleges that the quotes were fabricated and should not have been attributed to him.\r\nIn later recordings Butowsky told Wheeler that the claims being attributed to him were false but says that \"One day you're going to win an award for having said those things you didn't say.\" He also says \"I know that's not true, if I'm under oath, I would say I never heard him say that.\"\r\nThe lawsuit was dismissed in August 2018, alongside Rich's family lawsuit against Fox, with the presiding judge ruling that there was no evidence that Fox has manipulated claims he had made on recordings, while other statements that Wheeler claimed were defamatory were considered opinion.  However, information learned from the discovery phase of the lawsuit on how Fox News was handling the story were subsequently used by Rich's family in its lawsuit against the network after they successfully appealed the dismissal.\r\n\r\nFamily's reactions\r\nIn May 2017, Seth Rich's brother Aaron Rich issued a statement saying, \"We simply want to find his killers and grieve. Instead, we are stuck having to constantly fight against non-facts, baseless allegations, and general stupidity to defend my brother's name and legacy.\" The family spokesperson said \"At this point, only people with transparent political agendas or sociopaths are still perpetuating Seth Rich conspiracies.\"\r\nHis parents authored a piece in The Washington Post on May 23, 2017, titled: \"We're Seth Rich's parents. Stop politicizing our son's murder,\" in which they wrote:\r\n\r\nWe are asking you to please consider our feelings and words. There are people who are using our beloved Seth's memory and legacy for their own political goals, and they are using your outrage to perpetuate our nightmare.

On October 1, 2018, as part of a settlement they had reached with Aaron Rich, The Washington Times retracted the relevant articles and apologized to Rich and his family.\r\n\r\nLawsuit against Fox News\r\nIn March 2018, Rich's family filed a lawsuit against Fox News, Fox reporter Malia Zimmerman, and Fox contributor Ed Butowsky, for publishing a news report about Seth Rich. The suit alleges that the report fueled conspiracy theories about Rich's death and caused the family emotional distress. Judge George B. Daniels dismissed the lawsuit in August 2018 alongside the case against Fox News from Wheeler. Judge Daniels ruled that, although it was reasonable for plaintiffs to believe their son's death was being used for political purposes, the plaintiffs failed to allege \"intentional infliction\" of emotional distress on the part of defendants, as that standard is determined under New York state law: \"defamatory statements to news outlets 'fall well short of meeting the high standards for extreme and outrageous conduct.'

Among that information included the level of involvement that Butowsky had in preparing and coaching the Fox News hosts in the days before they broke their version of the Seth Rich story, his hiring of Wheeler, and his meeting with Spicer. On October 12, 2020, Fox News reached a settlement with the Rich family. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but were reported to be in the seven figures. The settlement also dismissed the actions against Zimmerman and Butowsky, which eliminated the need for Fox News hosts like Hannity and Dobbs to give testimony.

AIX Ventures is a venture capital fund that invests in artificial intelligence startups.\r\n\r\nEarly life and education\r\nSaria is from Darjeeling. She earned her bachelor's degree at Mount Holyoke College. She was awarded a full scholarship from Microsoft. In 2004 she joined Stanford University as a Rambus Corporation Fellow. She earned her Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees at Stanford University, supervised by Daphne Koller and advised by Anna Asher Penn and Sebastian Thrun. At Stanford University, Saria developed a statistical model that could predict premature baby outcomes with a 90% accuracy. The model used data from monitors, birth weight and length of time spent in the womb to predict whether a preemie would develop an illness.  She worked in the startup Aster Data Systems.\r\n\r\nCareer and research\r\nSaria believes that big data can be used to personalise healthcare. She is considered an expert in computational statistics and their applications to the real world. She uses Bayesian and probabilistic modelling. In 2014 Saria was funded by a $1.5 million Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation project that looked to make intensive care units safer. The project used data collected at patients' bedsides along with noninvasive 3D sensors that monitor care in patient's hospital rooms. The sensors collect information on steps that might have been missed by doctors; like washing hands.\r\nSaria uses big data to manage chronic diseases. She is part of a National Science Foundation (NSF) award that looks at scleroderma. She uses machine learning to analyse medical records and identify similar patterns of disease progression. The system works out which treatments have been effectively used for various symptoms to aid doctors in choosing treatment plans for specific patients.  She has developed another algorithm that can be used to predict and treat Septic shock. The algorithm used 16,000 items of patient health records and generates a targeted real-time warning (TREWS) score. She collaborated with David N. Hager to use the algorithm in clinics, and it was correct 86% of the time.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 384860, "end_char_idx": 389605, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2453378-6fd6-4a22-9662-d9cfb8c80507": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2453378-6fd6-4a22-9662-d9cfb8c80507", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "727e3483-c373-4e41-a179-c12bfde4b7cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "9fa84119619eede77502a3224f0be31d1156080026be2ba15ea49cf339a5d8ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b6404341-2b53-4293-9071-3c02aa9cc8ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e97161ccebf86acce1c8223f3d93725bfdefbf489e9255b376c9489e7c6afb8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The project used data collected at patients' bedsides along with noninvasive 3D sensors that monitor care in patient's hospital rooms.

Sinyangwe is a member of the Movement for Black Lives, the founder of Mapping Police Violence, a database of police killings in the United States and the Police Scorecard, a website with data on police use of force and accountability metrics on US police and sheriff's departments. Sinyangwe is also a co-founder of We the Protestors, a group of digital tools that include Campaign Zero, a policy platform to end police violence and a co-host of the Pod Save the People podcast, where he discusses the week's news with a panel of other activists.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nSinyangwe was born May 12, 1990, to a Tanzanian father and a European Jewish mother who met while studying at Cornell University. He grew up in the College Park neighborhood of Orlando, Florida and attended Winter Park High School in the International Baccalaureate program.

As protests emerged in the wake of the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, he connected with Ferguson activists online. With DeRay Mckesson, Brittney Packnett and Johnetta Elzie, he began working to develop policy solutions to address police violence in America. Sinyangwe particularly noticed the absence of official government statistics on police violence and began compiling them from other sources like Fatal Encounters and KilledbythePolice.net, in order to challenge claims about police shootings being rare events or only resulting from resisting arrest.\r\nWith other activists, Sinyangwe founded We the Protestors, an organization aimed at developing a set of digital tools to support Black Lives Matter activism. Sinyangwe built projects including a database of police killings, Mapping Police Violence, and a platform of policy solutions to end police violence called Campaign Zero. Sinyangwe also serves as a data scientist for OurStates.org, a project focused on state legislatures and with Mckesson and Brittney Packnett founded the Resistance Manual, an open-source project aimed at connecting anti-racist activists with activists focused on intersecting issues. He has also been responsible for a number of CPRA requests for RIPA-formatted police stops data through the non-profit organization MuckRock.\r\nDuring the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign, Sinyangwe and colleagues met with Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on these policy issues. He has been a vocal critic of the \"Ferguson Effect\", using data to refute the theory that policing had diminished and crime increased in face of activist scrutiny of police use of force. Melissa Harris-Perry has compared Sinyangwe to journalist and anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells, noting that Wells began her work by \"compil[ing] the data, the social science and research about how, when and where lynchings were happening to begin to make it stop.\"\r\nSinyangwe is a co-host of Mckesson's podcast Pod Save the People, which discusses the week's news with a panel of other activists including Mckesson, Packnett and Clint Smith. The podcast particularly focuses on race, grassroots activism, discrimination and other forms of inequality; recommending Pod Save The People in GQ, June Diane Raphael of How Did This Get Made? wrote, \"The stories they uplift and think critically about are the ones I'm now wondering why I've never been exposed to/exposed myself to.\" Sinyangwe has also been featured on CNN, MSNBC, BBC News, FiveThirtyEight, The Los Angeles Times, and other publications. He has written for the Huffington Post and The Guardian.\r\n\r\nAwards and fellowships\r\nIn 2017, Sinyangwe was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for law and policy. He was also a 2017 Echoing Green Black Male Achievement Fellow.\r\n\r\nPersonal life\r\nSinyangwe lives in New York City.\r\n\r\nSelected writings\r\n\"Cities That Reduced Arrests For Minor Offenses Also Saw Fewer Police Shootings\".

Since 2017, she has been Professor of Digital Cultural Heritage at the University of Edinburgh, and director of its Centre for Digital Scholarship. She previously taught at University College London, where she was Professor of Digital Humanities and served as director of its Centre for Digital Humanities from 2012 to 2017: she remains an honorary professor. She has a wide ranging academic background: she has an undergraduate degree in art history and English literature, then took a Master of Science (MSc) degree in computer science, before undertaking a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree at the University of Oxford in engineering.\r\n\r\nEarly life and education\r\nTerras was born in 1975 in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. She studied classical art history and English literature at the University of Glasgow. She was given the opportunity to hand in her dissertation as a website, and, after learning to code, did so in 1996. She graduated with an undergraduate Master of Arts (MA Hons) degree in 1997. She was then awarded a Scottish Government scholarship to undertake a master's degree in computer science. She studied software and systems at the University of Glasgow, graduating with a Master of Science (MSc) degree. Her master's thesis was supervised by Seamus Ross, and was a virtual reality model (in VRML 2.0) of the tomb of Sennedjem.\r\nTerras then moved to the University of Oxford, where she had funding via the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) to undertake a doctorate in engineering: she was based jointly in Oxford's Department of Engineering Science and the Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents. The project was concerned with using \"image processing and artificial intelligence to help read Ancient documents\" (specifically the Vindolanda tablets). Her thesis was titled \"Image to interpretation: towards an intelligent system to aid historians in the reading of the Vindolanda texts\", and was successfully submitted for her Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree in 2002.\r\n\r\nAcademic career\r\nIn August 2003, Terras joined University College London (UCL) as a lecturer in electronic communication and publishing and was based in the School of Library, Archive, and Information Studies. In 2010, she was promoted to Reader in Electronic Communication. She co-founded the UCL Centre for Digital Humanities and served as its director from 2012 to 2017. Since leaving UCL, she has maintained her links with the university as an honorary professor.\r\nIn October 2017, Terras moved to the University of Edinburgh, having been appointed Professor of Digital Cultural Heritage in its School of History, Classics and Archaeology.

He led the open government data community g0vhk from 2016 to 2021. He was an Election Committee member representing the information technology (IT) industry from 2016 to 2021 and ran for the Information Technology constituency in the 2020 Hong Kong legislative election as part of the pro-democratic caucus.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nWong grew up in North District, Hong Kong and lived in a public housing estate. He attended Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Kap Yan Directors' College and Saint Francis of Assisi's College, and was a three-time medallist in the Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics. His personal interest in democratic activism began when with the 500,000-strong demonstration against the National Security Bill 2003, in which he participated as a secondary school student.\r\nHe studied computer engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and began his professional career in software engineering. He worked in Beijing in 2013-14. He relocated back to Hong Kong around the time of the Umbrella Movement protests and began taking part internet freedom advocacy alongside his data scientist career.\r\n\r\nOpen data activism\r\nIn 2016, Wong founded g0vhk on the model of g0v Taiwan, a technology advocacy group for open government data. He led the creation of a g0vhk open political data platform collating attendance, speech, and voting records of incumbent Hong Kong legislative councillors, and information about candidates in the 2016 general election. Later that year, Wong ran for election to the Election Committee as a member of the IT Vision slate, part of the Democracy 300+ caucus to increase the pro-democratic camp's influence in the 2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election. IT Vision won all 30 seats in the Information Technology subsector due to the multiple non-transferable vote system.\r\nWong advocates that public bodies not only need to make content available to the general public, but also make them available in machine-readable formats. He criticized the complacency of civil servants who think they have complied with open data regulations but only post scan images of documents. He supports legislating a Public Records Act to codify the requirements for public bodies to disclose information, because the existing Code on Access to Information lacks enforceability.\r\nWong believes in an approach to open data that balances the right to know and the right to privacy. He criticized the Hong Kong public sector for using privacy concerns as an excuse to withhold data, exemplifying this issue with the abundance of rumours that stemmed from the Hong Kong Police Force's reluctance to publish data about tear gas use and about arrestees at protests. On the other hand, he also campaigned against the introduction of smart lamp-posts that have the hardware capability to record pedestrians' faces. Wong opined that, even if the Hong Kong government promises not to use facial recognition technology on the lamp-post footage, such footage would be a target of cyberattacks by malicious actors with access to facial recognition. During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, Wong represented the IT industry in a Citizen's Press Conference and responded to a question about vandalism of smart lamp-posts by protesters, saying that the general public was skeptical about the true purposes of the lamp-posts. He opined that technology innovation depends on trust, thus technology policy would be meaningless unless the government attempted to regain public trust by compromising on the Five Demands.\r\nAhead of the 2019 Hong Kong local elections, Wong led the g0vhk project Vote4.hk, which collated public data about candidates and compiled voter guides.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 425338, "end_char_idx": 429757, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a03547ae-4816-4deb-90db-d108de988e13": {"__data__": {"id_": "a03547ae-4816-4deb-90db-d108de988e13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "30342eaf-f4ae-4d7f-b723-30a3e339aa03", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "81d213cde1677a56a47e3fcbdeaaac95683e6c2aaa10a7d16067acc34d3dd5eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2f8f28c-57db-47e5-aaea-4a19b85d29b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6f585630dbf25ac880f1ef781627fdf974b3da4ac53308dca552d334ebe5ab62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "On the other hand, he also campaigned against the introduction of smart lamp-posts that have the hardware capability to record pedestrians' faces.

He opined that technology innovation depends on trust, thus technology policy would be meaningless unless the government attempted to regain public trust by compromising on the Five Demands.\r\nAhead of the 2019 Hong Kong local elections, Wong led the g0vhk project Vote4.hk, which collated public data about candidates and compiled voter guides. The pro-democratic camp won a landslide victory in the elections, but Wong criticized that the district councils continued to lag behind the trend in terms of open data, citing the difficulty for the general public to obtain data about council budgets, and even where data were available often only scans of paper documents would be provided, making it difficult for citizens to monitor their council's performance.\r\nIn January 2020, Wong Ho Wa and Vote4.hk colleagues Brian Leung and Nandi Wong saw that public information about the Covid-19 pandemic in Hong Kong was disorganized, so they created the COVID-19 in HK dashboard to collate information about confirmed cases, disease transmission hotspots, and surgical mask market prices. The dashboard attracted 400,000 page views per day during the peak of the pandemic and was maintained by a team of some 20 volunteers assisted by automatic web crawlers. Wong Ho Wa said that the hardest part of maintaining the dashboard was finding committed volunteers to fact-check reports of unscrupulous mask merchants. Wong criticized the Centre for Health Protection's (CHP) practice of withholding data about new Covid-19 cases from their website for many hours after their daily press conference, which forced data reusers to watch CHP's press conferences in order to obtain the latest data. Nevertheless, Wong commended the CHP for providing an API for its coronavirus case data and that the Hong Kong government's open data practices had improved significantly in the late 2010s, even though Hong Kong still fell short of the Open Knowledge Foundation's standards, lagging behind nearby regions like Shanghai and Taiwan.\r\n\r\nLegCo campaign\r\nIn July 2020, Charles Mok, the incumbent Information Technology functional constituency representative in Hong Kong Legislative Council (LegCo), announced that he would not seek re-election. In an interview, Mok said that he had been searching for a \"Plan B\" candidate in preparation for possible widespread disqualification of incumbent pro-democratic legislators, but in the process decided that he should retire from LegCo and endorse a younger candidate as his \"Plan A\" instead.\r\nOn 19 July, Wong Ho Wa declared his candidacy for the Information Technology constituency in the 2020 general election. In his manifesto, he said that he had been a longstanding supporter of liberal democracy. He stated that the Hong Kong national security law threatened internet freedom in Hong Kong, which was the lifeline of Hong Kong's IT industry, and that \"the Great Firewall of China is now at our doorstep\". He focused his campaign on using IT expertise to advocate for the freedom of information and for civic participation in government.\r\nCommentators generally classify Wong as a moderate democrat. Wong and several other pro-democratic candidates for the functional constituencies signed the \"confirmation form\" pledging allegiance to the Hong Kong Basic Law, despite the form being a source of disagreement within the pro-democratic camp. Wong said he did not want to define himself in terms of any specific political faction, as he wanted to represent the broad range of political opinions within the IT industry. The 2020 general election was eventually postponed by the Hong Kong government, ostensibly due to the pandemic, and eventually replaced by the revamped 2021 Hong Kong legislative election and the 2021 Hong Kong Election Committee Subsector elections.\r\nIn January 2021, police raided Wong's home and office in Hong Kong amidst the mass arrests of participants of the pro-democracy legislative election primaries, but Wong was not arrested. The pro-democracy primaries did not include the Information Technology constituency in which Wong sought election to LegCo. In June, Wong announced that g0vhk was to be disbanded due to changes in the political climate.\r\nThe Information Technology functional constituency was abolished in the 2021 elections and replaced by a \"Technology and Innovation\" functional constituency whose franchise was limited to representatives of about 100 industry groups vetted by the government.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 428769, "end_char_idx": 433877, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2f8f28c-57db-47e5-aaea-4a19b85d29b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2f8f28c-57db-47e5-aaea-4a19b85d29b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a03547ae-4816-4deb-90db-d108de988e13", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "ed2ee26beeff9459e32d98253a381eebcc6caee3b1d9a35b5e939a3f96551fb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "05161266-82a2-483d-bb8f-5b4681ee2a78", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "89a8c0cd9c6a1048eafc26f0951feb0530a5358b1962e30b76220cd0bae728c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The 2020 general election was eventually postponed by the Hong Kong government, ostensibly due to the pandemic, and eventually replaced by the revamped 2021 Hong Kong legislative election and the 2021 Hong Kong Election Committee Subsector elections.\r\nIn January 2021, police raided Wong's home and office in Hong Kong amidst the mass arrests of participants of the pro-democracy legislative election primaries, but Wong was not arrested.

He is noted as the whistleblower who released a cache of documents to The Guardian he obtained while he worked at Cambridge Analytica. This prompted the Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal, which triggered multiple government investigations and raised wider concerns about privacy, the unchecked power of Big Tech, and Western democracy's vulnerability to disinformation. Wylie was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018. He appeared in the 2019 documentary The Great Hack. He is the head of insight and emerging technologies at H&M.\r\n\r\nEarly life and education\r\nWylie was born to parents Kevin Wylie and Joan Carruthers, both physicians. He was raised in Victoria, British Columbia. As a child he was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD. After being abused at the age of 6 at the British Columbia Ministry of Education, which the school had tried to conceal, he sued. After a six-year legal battle, winning a settlement of $290,000 at the age of 14. The agency was also forced to overhaul its policies on inclusion and bullying. He left school in 2005 at the age of 16 without a qualification, and when asked about his \"probable destiny\" on his school leaver's yearbook page, he stated \"just another dissociative smear merchant peddling backroom hackery in its purest Machiavellian form\".\r\nHe taught himself to code at age 19.\r\nIn 2010, at the age of 20, he began studying law at the London School of Economics, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 2013, specialising in technology, media and IP law, and being awarded the Dechert Prize for Property Law.\r\nWylie has a PhD in predicting fashions trends from the University of the Arts London.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\n2005\u20132012\r\nAfter leaving school, Wylie moved to Ottawa, where he began volunteering for \"a short stint\" in the parliamentary office of his Member of Parliament, Keith Martin. During his time in Martin's office, he overlapped with Martin's executive assistant Jeff Silvester, who was later commissioned by Wylie to set up AggregateIQ. The following year, he got a job as a contractor in the office of the Canadian opposition leader, Michael Ignatieff, at the age of 19. During his contract, Wylie begun developing strategies on how to capitalize data harvested through social media for political gain. The party officials did not renew Wylie's contract in 2009, and a senior insider said it was largely because his ideas were seen as \"too invasive.\" Of Wylie, the colleague said, \"Let's say he had boundary issues on data even back then. He effectively pitched an earlier version of [the Cambridge Analytica data-harvesting operation] to us back in 2009 and we said, 'No.'\"\r\nIn 2008, he volunteered on the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, learning about microtargeting from Obama campaign adviser Ken Strasma. There has been some dispute over whether his volunteer role was a senior or a junior-level data entry role.\r\nIn 2012, Wylie worked for the Liberal Democrats in the UK on voter targeting.\r\n\r\nSCL Elections and Cambridge Analytica, 2013\u201314\r\nIn 2013, Wylie discovered some research on psychological profiling using social data funded by DARPA and used that knowledge when he began working for SCL Elections, formerly Strategic Communication Laboratories, and its offshoot for American elections (later renamed Cambridge Analytica), an international consultancy specialising in data-driven psychographic targeting in elections.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 436681, "end_char_idx": 441069, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be87dd37-050d-45f5-b111-c33e8cdd5ce8": {"__data__": {"id_": "be87dd37-050d-45f5-b111-c33e8cdd5ce8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "05161266-82a2-483d-bb8f-5b4681ee2a78", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "a435fb94cab1f6d4de0972c0447d4c6ba2cb7613235613b07c48a6ffeab1280a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "71fe14b2-23ff-4b65-a5f6-370f101263c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e7a8834291998dcdde87c98a219aec89fca7b1f0beacbe1c302a71f20b8c3c9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "He effectively pitched an earlier version of [the Cambridge Analytica data-harvesting operation] to us back in 2009 and we said, 'No.'\"\r\nIn 2008, he volunteered on the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, learning about microtargeting from Obama campaign adviser Ken Strasma. There has been some dispute over whether his volunteer role was a senior or a junior-level data entry role.\r\nIn 2012, Wylie worked for the Liberal Democrats in the UK on voter targeting.\r\n\r\nSCL Elections and Cambridge Analytica, 2013\u201314\r\nIn 2013, Wylie discovered some research on psychological profiling using social data funded by DARPA and used that knowledge when he began working for SCL Elections, formerly Strategic Communication Laboratories, and its offshoot for American elections (later renamed Cambridge Analytica), an international consultancy specialising in data-driven psychographic targeting in elections. Alexander Nix recruited Wylie for his small team in SCL and Wylie assembled the core of what would later become Cambridge Analytica, made up of psychologists and data scientists. His role at Cambridge Analytica was reported by the Parliament of the United Kingdom as its \"director of research\" and by Time as a \"founder,\" but a Queen's Counsel (QC) report by Julian Malins disputed those titles, documenting that his employment contract stated he was hired as a part-time \"intern\" on a student visa, limited to 19 hours of work a week.\r\nWylie's role at SCL was first revealed in May 2017 by The Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who wrote that \"He\u2019s the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica\". He said that traditional analytics around voter profiling used voting records and purchase histories to predict voter behavior, but that it was useless for learning if a voter was \"a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult,\" which were among the traits Wylie and his team determined were uniquely susceptible to political messaging. Wylie found research done at Cambridge University which mapped Facebook likes to personality traits, research that was done by paying users to take a quiz and download an app that scraped private information from the profiles of the participants and their friends. Academic Aleksandr Kogan was commissioned by Wylie's team to build a similar application, which illegally scraped the personal data of 87 million people from their Facebook profiles, and the data was used to develop new forms of psychographic microtargeting. Facebook denied any knowledge of Kogan's program, citing that he had said he was \"collecting information for academic purposes,\" and agreed that it would not be used for \"commercial purposes.\" Kogan declined to comment on the matter, citing Non-disclosure agreements with both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, beyond the statements that his application was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app,\" that Wylie's team assured him that their usage was legal, and that he did not personally profit from the work. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, and further denied they influenced the outcome of the 2016 United States presidential election.\r\nWylie worked for American Republican candidates affiliated with the party's \"Tea Party\" wing in the 2014 United States elections; and on disinformation campaigns for political parties in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana and the Caribbean.\r\nPrior to his departure, Wylie had shared his profiling tool with Robert Mercer, the billionaire who funded Cambridge Analytica and later became one of Donald Trump's mega-donors, and with Steve Bannon, who effectively ran the company from 2014 onward and later went on to become Trump's campaign manager. Wylie's research work included message-testing work for Steve Bannon on building a wall on the American-Mexican border. He later recounted, \"My ears perked up when I [later] started hearing some of these things like 'drain the swamp' or 'build the wall' or 'the deep state' because these were all narratives that had come out from the research that we were doing,\" and that the wall \"is not really about stopping immigrants. It's to embody separation. If you can embody that separation and you can further distance in the minds of Americans us here in America and them elsewhere, even if it is just across a river, or just across a desert, then you have won that culture war.\"\r\nWylie has said he did not realize the \"potential misuse\" of his research at the time, referring to it as his \"real failure,\" and to the work he did as, \"political hackery.\" He said that if he had taken a job offer with Deloitte, Cambridge Analytica would not exist.

He resigned in 2014.\r\n\r\nEunoia Technologies, 2014\u201317\r\nIn 2014, Wylie co-founded Eunoia Technologies along with former SCL/Cambridge Analytica senior staff Brent Clickard, Mark Gettleson and Tadas Jucikas. In describing his ambitions for developing Eunoia, Wylie stated \"I want to build the NSA\u2019s wet dream\". \r\nEunoia Technologies has been criticized for the similar psychographic profiling tactics used by Cambridge Analytica, using the same dataset shared by Kogan.\r\nIn December 2014, Wylie registered Eunoia Technologies Inc in the tax haven of Delaware. In May 2015, a wholly owned UK subsidiary of Eunoia was registered in the UK as Eunoia Technologies Ltd. The name \"Eunoia\" meant \"beautiful thinking\" in ancient Greek, and the company offered election-related consultancy services including \"psychographic microtargeting\", \"multi-agent system voter behaviour simulation\", and \"data & communications management\".\r\nWylie's lawyer subsequently assured journalists that Eunoia had no data, but parliamentary testimony from Kogan later revealed that Eunoia had possessed Kogan's full data set of 87 million Facebook users; and that SCL/Cambridge Analytica had only ever had access to some 4% of the scraped data, \"in contrast with the contract with Mr. Wylie\u2019s entity\r\nEunoia, where Eunoia received all of the page like data as well as dyads\", and that unlike SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie's company had been the only organization Kogan granted complete access to the dataset.\r\nDuring the Easter of 2015, two of Wylie's Eunoia colleagues who had joined him from SCL, Tadas Jucikas and Mark Gettleson, flew to New York to meet Donald Trump's then-campaign manager on his 2016 presidential bid, Corey Lewandowski, for a meeting in a Central Park hotel. They pitched for Eunoia to work on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, but were ultimately unsuccessful. The approach to the Trump campaign was made with Wylie's knowledge as CEO of Eunoia, and reportedly had his blessing.\r\nIn November 2015, Eunoia Technologies pitched Facebook data-mining techniques to the Liberal Party of Canada, securing a $100,000 contract in January 2016 for \"a short-lived pilot project\" with the Liberal Caucus Research Bureau. However, the contract was not renewed beyond the pilot.\r\nFrom 2015, Wylie and Gettleson became embroiled in litigation with SCL, alleging that Eunoia had infringed SCL's intellectual property, had misappropriated SCL's data, had attempted to 'poach' other SCL contractors, and had attempted to 'poach' SCL's clients. Wylie elaborated on the Eunoia allegations when denying them: \"They tried to sue me over their claims that I was somehow trying to steal their clients, or to somehow try to interfere with their contractual relations with other employees, or what have you.\" SCL later claimed that Eunoia had been \"the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent the misuse of the company's intellectual property\". A QC's report noted:\r\n\r\n\"On 21 May 2015, SCL discovered that Eunoia Technologies Limited had approached at least one of SCL\u2019s existing clients in the USA, following confirmation from a US political client that they had received a proposal from Eunoia Technologies, which purported to deliver exactly the same services as SCL. Consequently, SCL\u2019s lawyers wrote to Wylie and others at Eunoia Technologies Limited regarding suspected breaches of covenants on intellectual property, client solicitation, staff solicitation and non-competition.\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 444072, "end_char_idx": 448362, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e173349f-7795-49f5-9cf8-2cb763b11b04": {"__data__": {"id_": "e173349f-7795-49f5-9cf8-2cb763b11b04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "71fe14b2-23ff-4b65-a5f6-370f101263c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "b0713d9b223b5ea0cf77af7a70bac1afc09833231fe74cb3e1c2517db57c590f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "757f3710-a808-4630-a417-638ad8069d05", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d0e0877c1a2ad693e8c31982a6c6bf57efe478a2b24edd32c4254bd606f698d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Wylie elaborated on the Eunoia allegations when denying them: \"They tried to sue me over their claims that I was somehow trying to steal their clients, or to somehow try to interfere with their contractual relations with other employees, or what have you.\" SCL later claimed that Eunoia had been \"the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent the misuse of the company's intellectual property\".

He has conceded that most of the key personnel involved in the Vote Leave campaign's digital and campaign financing controversies were all friends or colleagues of his, including BeLeave founder Darren Grimes, BeLeave Treasurer Shahmir Sanni, AggregateIQ founders Zack Massingham and Jeff Silvester (a company set up at Wylie's instigation when he was SCL's director of research), and Vote Leave HQ staffer Mark Gettleson (who recruited AggregateIQ to work for Vote Leave), with Sanni and Gettleson later becoming witnesses in criminal investigations of the Vote Leave campaign.\r\nIt subsequently emerged that in January 2016, Wylie and Gettleson wrote a joint proposal, on behalf of Eunoia, to Vote Leave campaign Director Dominic Cummings, to pitch for a pilot providing microtargeting services to the Leave campaign in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. The pitch was ultimately unsuccessful, with Cummings later describing them as \"charlatans\". Gettleson subsequently admitted that they had only made the pitch to Vote Leave after first making a pitch to the opposing Remain campaign in November 2015.\r\nIt was subsequently reported that on the morning of the referendum result, Wylie posted the \"Brexit butterfly\" graphic to his social media in support of Brexit, along with the caption \"We did it\", tagging four individuals: Conservative MP Nigel Evans of the Vote Leave campaign board; BeLeave founder Darren Grimes, later found guilty by the Electoral Commission of using BeLeave as a vehicle for illegally breaking campaign spending limits; and Leave campaigners Luis Lopez and Shahmir Sanni, with the latter later becoming a \"whistleblower\" on Vote Leave's campaign finance breaches.\r\n\r\nWhistleblowing\r\nIn March 2018, Wylie released a cache of documents to The Guardian centered around Cambridge Analytica's alleged unauthorized possession of personal private data from up to 87 million Facebook user accounts, which was obtained for the purpose of creating targeted digital advertising campaigns.  The campaigns were based on psychological and personality profiles mined from the Facebook data which Wylie had commissioned in a mass-data scraping exercise.\r\nOn the 18 March 2018, Wylie gave a series of detailed interviews to The Observer with revelations about his time at SCL/Cambridge Analytica, presenting himself as a \"whistleblower\". He subsequently provided testimony and materials to a range of inquiries and legislatures around the world, and his revelations were instrumental in the May 2018 collapse of Cambridge Analytica. Wylie admitted to having been the principal anonymous source for a May 2017 The Observer article by Carole Cadwalladr, which first drew attention to Cambridge Analytica. Cadwalladr subsequently related how she had tracked Wylie down via LinkedIn in early 2017, and after finding him \"fascinating, funny and brilliant\", had spent a year persuading him to go public with his allegations.\r\nOn March 27, 2018, Wylie provided evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the UK Parliament that contained further revelations about the practices at Cambridge Analytica and its associated companies.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 447422, "end_char_idx": 452113, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "757f3710-a808-4630-a417-638ad8069d05": {"__data__": {"id_": "757f3710-a808-4630-a417-638ad8069d05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e173349f-7795-49f5-9cf8-2cb763b11b04", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "4e79425610c64b9b46d0d4bd6a9d0e1e4dc13655a77a993efc036891963ceebd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6d3e0437-2b90-415e-b936-e7302dc1f387", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "55890b8ec63ae74c60bdc6c264c64f196aade2ef62ed1f0ae16839b42a2e615a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "He subsequently provided testimony and materials to a range of inquiries and legislatures around the world, and his revelations were instrumental in the May 2018 collapse of Cambridge Analytica.

He is also known for his more recent work as founder and CEO of Climax Foods, a California-based biotechnology company modeling dairy and other animal products directly from plant ingredients. Prior to becoming an entrepreneur, Zahn directed UC Berkeley's Center for Cosmological Physics alongside George Smoot and Saul Perlmutter and was Head of Data Science at Google\r\n\r\nEarly life and education\r\nZahn was born in Munich and studied physics and philosophy at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, doing his Diploma thesis in theoretical astrophysics jointly at Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and New York University, graduating summa cum laude. He went on to do his dissertation work in cosmology at Harvard University, before winning the inaugural prize fellowship at UC Berkeley's Center for Cosmological Physics, funded directly by the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nIndustry career\r\nIn 2019, Oliver founded Climax Foods to replace animal foods with dairy and meat directly produced from plants, circumventing the animals' complex metabolisms and thereby reducing greenhouse gases and water use caused by animal agriculture. Climax aims to outcompete animal products by offering zero-compromise alternatives that are purely plant-based, yet indistinguishable in terms of taste and texture, and better than their animal-based competitors in terms of nutrition and price.\r\n\r\nAcademic career\r\nZahn has worked on a broad range of topics in theoretical, computational, and observational astrophysics and cosmology. Working with multiple multi-national collaborations, he has co-authored more than 100 peer-reviewed journal articles with more than 14,000 citations and a h-index of 68.\r\nAs an undergraduate at Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, Zahn studied the early Universe and constrained deviations from the laws of gravity and electro-magnetism during the Big Bang.\r\nWhile a doctoral student at Harvard University, Zahn and co-authors Smith and Dore detected, for the first time, gravitational lensing in the cosmic microwave background. The finding has since been confirmed by teams analyzing data from the Planck, Polarbear, and SPT telescopes \r\nIn a separate series of papers  Zahn introduced statistical measures to use redshifted 21 cm radiation to study otherwise inaccessible periods of the Universe's structure formation.

She testified that Facebook negligence allowed those authoritarian regimes to manipulate public discourse. Zhang reported that most of these subversive networks use Facebook's organization pages, configured with human names and photographs to mimic human accounts in order to successfully evade Facebook's emerging efforts to counter fake users.\r\nThe British newspaper The Guardian dedicated a series, The Facebook Loophole, based on Zhang's resources and accounts, to report on these Facebook-based political manipulations. Following later whistleblower Frances Haugen's testimony on Facebook's impact on children, interest toward Zhang's testimony increased with investigation from European and American legislative bodies ongoing.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nZhang worked at Facebook for two years as a data scientist until September 2020. She was in the \"Fake Engagement\" team, a sub-division of the \"Spam team\" assigned to look for abuses of the platform. Zhang investigated \u201cfake engagement\u201d such as inauthentic likes, comments, shares, and reactions. There was no Facebook team dedicated to investigating and rooting out these fake or abusive organization pages.\r\n\r\nUnveiled government abuses\r\nShe found series of \"multiple blatant attempts by foreign national governments to abuse our platform on vast scales to mislead their own citizenry, [which] caused international news on multiple occasions\". Most notably, these included:\r\n\r\nHonduras, 2018: President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez - From June to July 2018, 78% of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s Facebook posts received likes that were not from real people, artificially boosting his apparent popular support by a factor of five. The social manager of Hern\u00e1ndez's official Facebook pages, for both Hern\u00e1ndez and his late sister who had served as communications minister, was directly controlling several hundreds of fake entities. This campaign used Facebook's Organization Pages, configured with human names and photographs, to add support and to lure unaware readers.\r\nAzerbaijan, 2019: Zhang found the ruling party to be using thousands of Organization Pages to harass opposition parties.

She declined a $64,000 severance package attached to a non-disparagement agreement restricting her ability to speak publicly about Facebook issues. On her departure day, she posted a 7,800-word departure message to Facebook's internal message board outlining Facebook\u2019s failure to combat political manipulation campaigns similar to the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.

On her departure day, she posted a 7,800-word departure message to Facebook's internal message board outlining Facebook\u2019s failure to combat political manipulation campaigns similar to the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Anticipating Facebook's deletion of the post, she created a personal, password-protected website with a copy of the post, then distributed its web address and password to Facebook co-workers.\r\nFacebook suppressed the message on the internal board, then contacted Zhang's web hosting service and domain registrar to request and force her private website offline.\r\n\r\nFacebook criticisms\r\nZhang argued that Facebook was not acting out of malice, but rather in slapdash, haphazard ways, concerned with self preservation and public relations. She pointed out several shortcomings in Facebook's management of such unauthentic political engagement on its services.\r\n\r\nFacebook priority assessment. Structure and effort investments focuses on \u201clarge-scale\u201d issues (ex: spam) rather that specific uncivic and political cases. Issues are prioritized by volume, so outright political manipulations in smaller countries are discounted despite their real impact. Zhang reported that 99% of resources are dedicated to fight spams. Expansion to fight political and election manipulations was rejected due to limitation of human resources.\r\nFacebook has an \"enforcement gap\", with a dedicated team fighting fake accounts, but no team fighting fake organizations that can work like and mimic user accounts.\r\nFacebook minimized bottom-up alerts by on-the-ground data analysts.\r\nFacebook investment priorities and associated internal workload makes it impossible to properly manage political manipulations.\r\nFacebook decision processes are generally haphazard, despite its effort to project itself as a fully competent entity.\r\nFacebook has a Western-centric focus. Western occurrences of political manipulations are dealt with rapidly, while responses to occurrences in other countries are delayed or not responded to at all.\r\nFacebook waits for and reacts to media coverage in a public relationship management approach. Facebook management has used negative media coverage to assess priorities, arguing that no previous media coverage means no relative importance of an issue.\r\nFacebook acts with no public oversight. Low-level data analysts have control and censorship power over world leaders and public discourses, with the capacity to let political manipulation continue or to stop it. While at Facebook, Zhang had monitored and personally taken or not taken action in countless countries, some of which were later shaken by civil unrest. Zhang declared she therefore has \"blood on [her] hands\".\r\n\r\nReaction to Frances Haugen\r\nZhang has expressed support for another Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen, who shared internal company documents with The Wall Street Journal and on October 5, 2021, testified before the United States Senate Commerce Committee's Sub-Committee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security. On October 12, 2021, Zhang told CNN she has shared documents about Facebook with a United States law enforcement agency, and that she is available to testify before Congress and is encouraged by the bipartisan support for congressional action after Haugen's testimony.\r\n\r\nBritish Parliament testimony\r\nOn October 14, 2021, it was announced Zhang would testify before the British Parliament on October 18, 2021, about \"her work as a data scientist for the Facebook Site Integrity fake engagement team, dealing with bot accounts, often operated by government backed agencies in countries such as Russia,\" according to Damian Collins, the chair of the British Parliament Online Safety Bill committee.\r\nOn October 18, Zhang testified to the British Parliament. The hearing was via video conference and was mostly filled with members working on a bill to tackle harmful online contents. Zhang stated that:\r\n\r\nFacebook observably neglects and allows disinformation campaigns on Facebook, to prioritize profits. This is consequential to Facebook, a company, structural mission to first and foremost make profit and protect itself.\r\nFacebook observably allows authoritarian governments to manipulate political discourse.\r\nFacebook observably was more reluctant to remove fake accounts if those accounts were connected to political leaders. This preferential treatment encourages major politicians to continue the violation and to do so openly.\r\nFacebook observably let fake engagement run among developing countries' online communities. Facebook\u2019s vice-President of Integrity Guy Rosen, stated that Facebook would focus its limited human resources on Western democracies and monitoring hostile actions from their immediate online threats such as Russia and Iran. Human resources dedicated to fighting Facebook-based manipulations differs considerably.\r\nFacebook senior management observably shown indifference and deflection when facing the issue of political manipulations on Facebook.\r\nFacebook senior management has conflict of interest, having to both keep good relations with political leaders and to set the rules for unacceptable violations on the platform.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 462654, "end_char_idx": 468099, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3990194-8adf-4a4f-9f8c-d8a174b34aa1": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3990194-8adf-4a4f-9f8c-d8a174b34aa1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9fa1c8c5-e6ea-4c58-ab36-65e295d07847", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "eeeb030dd2ed39387c7049da782cdc77f7bc767f91d03ee880722bec449766a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "caba36ba-357b-40de-bf1f-62c7c8f419dd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5615f4766d04ae9c8a585191bfd6b5fdf4d7a881ed1b32c440c12a05f2fe553f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This is consequential to Facebook, a company, structural mission to first and foremost make profit and protect itself.\r\nFacebook observably allows authoritarian governments to manipulate political discourse.\r\nFacebook observably was more reluctant to remove fake accounts if those accounts were connected to political leaders.

She stated that he was active in abusive conduct in two separate instances, once in 2004 as an adolescent, and once in 2010 while she was a student at the University of Michigan. She argued that his actions violated university policy on sexual and gender-based misconduct. The complaint was dismissed by the university, with the case coordinator reasoning that the conduct alleged in the complaint did not occur in a university program or activity.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nChristopher Wylie\r\nCriticism of Facebook\r\nFacebook Files\r\nFrances Haugen\r\nInstagram's impact on people\r\nRussian interference in the 2016 United States elections\r\nEdward Snowden\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nExternal links\r\n\"Facebook accus\u00e9 par une ancienne employ\u00e9e d'avoir ignor\u00e9 des tentatives de manipulations politiques dans plusieurs pays\".

Allam and her mother volunteered at local food banks and helped set up homes for single mothers and refugees in the Research Triangle. A devout Muslim, she began wearing hijab full-time when she was in eighth grade.\r\nAllam graduated from Needham B. Broughton High School, a magnet school in downtown Raleigh, where she was a member of the varsity lacrosse team. As a high school student, she chaired the Triangle Health Fair, a Muslim student-led campaign to partner with local doctors, chiropractors, and dentists to provide free health care to low-income community members.\r\nShe graduated from North Carolina State University with a degree in sustainable materials and technology. While at university, she founded the NC State For Bernie Club and became co-chair of the Triangle For Bernie Club.\r\n\r\nPolitical career\r\nAllam was inspired to become politically involved after her best friend, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, was one of the three people killed in the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting. She had been a bridesmaid at Abu-Salha's wedding that December. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Department of Justice also launched their own investigations into the shooting. Federal authorities could not find sufficient evidence to charge Hicks with a hate crime.  Allam became involved in the grassroots movement and worked as a political director for U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, as well as an organizing director for Justice Cheri Beasley's campaign for the North Carolina Supreme Court. She was the 2016 Political Director in North Carolina, South Carolina, New Jersey and New York for Sanders' presidential campaign.\r\nShe is a 2019 alumna of Durham's chapter of the New Leaders Council.\r\n\r\nInitial runs for office\r\nAllam decided to run for public office after having worked behind the scenes in the progressive movement and with voter mobilization efforts because she believed there needed to be more progressive candidates representing the diversity of the American people. She was elected as the Third Vice Chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party in January 2017, becoming the first Muslim American to serve on the party's executive council, and was appointed as the Chair of the Durham Mayor's Council for Women in 2018.\r\nAs a member of the Mayor's Council for Women, she advised Mayor Steve Schewel on issues pertaining to the rights of women and LGBTQIA community members, especially non-binary and transgender people. As Third Vice Chair of the Democratic Party in North Carolina, she served alongside Second Chair Matt Hughes, former First Chair Aisha Dew, Party Secretary Melvin Williams, and former State Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin. She also served as a delegate at the 2016 Democratic National Convention and the 2020 Democratic National Convention.\r\n\r\nDurham County Board of Commissioners\r\nAllam was elected to the Durham County Board of Commissioners in 2020 with endorsements from the Durham Association of Educators, Equality North Carolina, and the People's Alliance PAC. When Allam announced her candidacy for Durham County Commissioner, her family members received Islamophobic hate mail via social media platforms. She was elected to serve alongside Nimasheena Burns, Wendy Jacobs, Heidi Carter, and Brenda Howerton. This was the first time that Durham County has had an all-woman board of commissioners in its 139-year history.

Allam lost the primary to her more moderate opponent by 9 points.\r\n\r\nPolitical views\r\nAllam ran for Durham County Commissioner on a platform centered on addressing economic inequality. Campaign priorities included a $15 minimum wage for county workers, boosting mental health services in schools and investing in businesses run by women and people of color.\r\nShe believes that charter schools have increased racial segregation in Durham schools. As a county commissioner, Allam stated she plans to increase the minimum wage of Durham Public Schools classified staff to U.S. $15 an hour and enact property tax assistance programs. She has stated that evictions and lack of affordable housing opportunities are also a crisis in the county, and referenced the issue of gentrification misplacing Black families from their homes in Durham's historical African-American neighborhoods. Allam has also called for more funding and community investment into Durham Public Schools and Durham Technical Community College, saying that education is tied to economic and racial justice issues. Allam supports organized labor unions. She blames the North Carolina General Assembly for inadequate funding for public schools.\r\nAllam has been criticized for her past statements and tweets in regards to Israel that some have seen as Anti-Zionist or anti-Semitic. In 2021, Allam apologized to the Jewish community for her past statements and committed to \"a movement for justice and peace, in which anti-Semitism must have no home.\" While Allam received endorsements in her race from figures like Ilhan Omar, who have been in the past accused of antisemitism, Valerie Foushee, her primary opponent,  began to receive funds and assistance from pro-Israel groups such as AIPAC and Sam Bankman-Fried's Protect Our Future PAC, prompting allegations that Foushee's campaign had succeeded primarily due to support from dark money as the race became \"the most expensive Democratic congressional primary in North Carolina history\".\r\n\r\nPersonal life\r\nShe lives in Durham with her husband, Towqir Aziz, and two dogs named Otis and Nala.

For her masters, she studied creative communication technology at New York University.\r\n\r\nMachine learning and art\r\nDavis's work as a generative artist focused on music, sentiment analysis and bias in datasets.\r\nA major theme of Davis's work was translating text into music, particularly generating music from the emotional data of the text. One of the projects Davis worked on turned publicly available books into music, generating music based on the emotion of the input text. Initially, her analysis was able to pick up the \"rhythm\" of books, for instance short sentences for Ernest Hemingway, and more flowery rhythms for work from Virginia Woolf. She built this work using a resource by Saif Mohammad, who had developed a lexicon mapping a large set of words onto eight basic emotions. The resulting tool, Transprose, created short musical pieces that mirrored the emotional tone of various novels.\r\nShe used a similar algorithm to generate melodies based on news articles, which were used to collaborate with composer Mathieu Lamboley to create a symphony for a 50-person orchestra. This was performed in the Louvre in Paris, France.\r\nShe was commissioned by the Italian art collective D20 to produce a piece played on a factory-turned instrument, called \"Fabbrica Alta\". Her piece \"Percival\", commissioned by SynthBeats Laptop Orchestra, was a piece designed to be played by six performers and also focused on subjective interpretation of text translated into music.\r\nIn 2019, Davis co-created an installation called The Laughing Room with author Jonny Sun. They trained an AI on standup comedy transcripts from women, nonbinary, and BIPOC comedians to learn what was funny; the AI was then placed in a room with chairs and a sofa, and people could talk to it to try evoking a laughing response. This was installed at the 2019 TED Conference, with additional installations at the Cambridge Public Library and The New American Festival.\r\nDavis often presented on bias in machine learning datasets and about her own work; she regularly spoke at international art-tech festivals including Eyeo, Strange Loop, and Kikk Festival. In 2019, she opened the renowned Transmediale, an annual festival for art and digital culture in Berlin. In September 2019, the Library of Congress invited her to speak as part of their Machine Learning + Libraries report on the state of the field, where she advocated that \"a dataset is a worldview\" and that \"classification is violence\" while urging caution in choosing input data used to train machine learning models.\r\n\r\nLong COVID research and advocacy\r\nDavis got COVID-19 in the first wave, in March 2020. At this point, the public health narrative was that people either fully recovered from COVID or died. Davis developed neurological issues that did not pass, including cognitive deficits (not being able to concentrate) and dysautonomia (dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system).  When she still had severe symptoms after three weeks and her physician attributed her symptoms to ADHD, she started to look for others experiencing the longer-term effects of COVID-19.\r\nA New York Times article by Fiona Lowenstein detailed a similar experience. At this point, she joined the Body Politic COVID-19 support group founded by Lowenstein. In their \"data nerds\" Slack channel, she connected with other people with a science or data background. Together they founded the Patient-Led Research Collaborative (PLRC). In April 2020, the PLRC collected data on people with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms, and  a month later they were the first to publish a report on long COVID.\r\nThe work done by PLRC gained prominence after Ed Yong wrote a piece on it for The Atlantic, interviewing Davis and other patient-researchers. The CDC and NIH started contacting the group to share analysis. The early CDC documentation for long COVID was informed by PLRC's analysis, especially around what was happening to young and previously healthy people. PLRC mapped how long COVID symptoms changed over time.\r\nDavis co-authored the World Health Organization's case definition of post COVID-19 condition, published in 2021. She was still only able to work a couple hours per day at that point.

Gorcenski is a transgender woman.\r\n\r\nActivism\r\nUnite the Right\r\nIn August 2017, Gorcenski was a counter-protester at the Unite the Right rally in her city of residence of Charlottesville, Virginia. At the August 11 \"torch\" rally, she was sprayed in the face with pepper spray by white supremacist Christopher Cantwell, who pleaded guilty to charges of assault and was barred from Virginia for 5 years, and was also attacked by Atomwaffen Division member Vasillios Pistolis.\r\nIn the wake of her assault at the rally, Gorcenski and one other counter-protester pressed charges against Cantwell, who in turn filed a federal lawsuit against them. In response, Gorcenski and her co-defendant counter-sued Cantwell. In the lawsuit, Gorcenski was repeatedly misgendered by both Cantwell and his attorney, Elmer Woodard. Woodard's motions to have the court refer to Gorcenski by her pre-transition name (and for the court to use male pronouns) were both denied. Both lawsuits were settled in 2018 with a mutual release of claims.\r\nDue to her public opposition to the rally, Gorcenski was harassed online and doxed. She told The Intercept that she had been victim to transphobic harassment from before the rally in Charlottesville. Gorcenski was swatted in October 2017 after the rally's organizer Jason Kessler reportedly doxed her. Kessler was subsequently arrested, though charges were dismissed when new evidence showed Kessler did not control the account that posted Gorcenski's address. In 2018, due to safety concerns, Gorcenski left Charlottesville for Berlin, Germany, where she now resides.\r\n\r\nDigital activism\r\nGorcenski's experiences at Unite the Right led her to use her skills as a data scientist to help identify and dox  white nationalists and members of the alt-right engaged in criminal activity. Gorcenski created the website 'First Vigil' to track the trial information of white nationalists and associated individuals. The site uses court documents and other public records. Gorcenski was named one of the fifty most influential feminists in 2018 by Bitch magazine for her work in creating First Vigil. In 2016, Gorcenski criticized the ethics of a study by an independent researcher who released the private information on approximately 70,000 users of the dating website OkCupid. The study in question was widely panned for being unethical, racist, and a breach of user privacy. Gorcenski covered the issue in a discussion with Sarah Jeong at Mozfest in 2017. Gorcenski sometimes speaks about the ethics of emerging technology, such as consumer internet of things devices. In 2016, Gorcenski explored software quality controls for electronic voting machines, expressing concern for the apparent lack of mandatory standards.\r\nDuring the George Floyd protests in 2020, Gorcenski launched whentheycamedown, a people's history project to document the removal of statues of historical figures aligned with white supremacy and colonialism.\r\n\r\nWriting\r\nGorcenski is a sporadic political opinion writer. After president Donald Trump controversially stated that there were \"very fine people on both sides\" at the Charlottesville rally, Gorcenski wrote an op-ed for The Guardian where she argued that his speech demonstrated his unwillingness to criticize neo-Nazis, which emboldened white supremacy. Her criticism extends at times to the Democratic Party, where she takes issue with what she perceives as the exploitation of the terror attack at Unite the Right for political gains. As a transgender rights activist, she has written about healthcare concerns for transgender Americans.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nExternal links\r\nPersonal website\r\nFirst Vigil Archived 2019-01-17 at the Wayback Machine\r\nwhentheycamedown\r\n\r\nTitle: Susan K.

At Google, Haugen co-authored a patent for a method of adjusting the ranking of search results. During her career at Google, she completed her MBA; her tuition was paid by Google. While at Google, she was a technical co-founder of the desktop dating app Secret Agent Cupid, precursor to the mobile app Hinge.\r\nIn 2015, she began work as a data product manager at Yelp to improve search using image recognition, and after a year, moved to Pinterest.\r\nIn 2019, Haugen joined Facebook, after a person close to her became radicalized online; she \"felt compelled to take an active role in creating a better, less toxic Facebook\" and thought \"Facebook has the potential to bring out the best of us\". When Facebook recruited her, she expressed interest in a role related to misinformation; in 2019 she became a product manager on the Facebook civic integrity team. \r\nFollowing the 2020 United States elections, Facebook dissolved its civic integrity team, and Haugen became disillusioned. While still at Facebook, she decided to become a whistleblower, due to what she has since described as a pattern of Facebook's prioritization of profit over public safety, and left Facebook in May 2021. \r\nIn the spring of 2021, she contacted John Tye, a founder of the pro bono law firm Whistleblower Aid, for help; Tye agreed to represent her and to help protect her anonymity. In the late summer of 2021, Haugen began meeting with members of the United States Congress, including Senator Richard Blumenthal and Senator Marsha Blackburn.\r\n\r\nThe Facebook Files\r\nStarting in September 2021, The Wall Street Journal published The Facebook Files: A Wall Street Journal Investigation, a series of news reports \"based on a review of internal Facebook documents, including research reports, online employee discussions and drafts of presentations to senior management.\" The investigation was published in nine reports, including examinations of rules exemptions for high-profile users, Facebook's impacts on youth, the impacts of its 2018 algorithm changes, weaknesses in Facebook's response to human trafficking and drug cartels, and vaccine misinformation, followed by a profile article about Haugen, given that she had gathered the documents that supported the investigative reports. \r\nFollowing the publication of the Wall Street Journal articles about Facebook's practices, the United States Senate Commerce Committee's Sub-Committee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security scheduled two hearings, with Antigone Davis, the global head of safety for Facebook, the first to be questioned, on September 30, 2021, Haugen, the hitherto-anonymous whistleblower, was questioned on October 5, 2021.\r\nOn October 3, 2021, Haugen disclosed her identity as the Facebook whistleblower when she appeared on 60 Minutes. During the interview, she discussed the Facebook program known as \"Civic Integrity\", which had been intended to curb misinformation and other threats to election security. The program was dissolved following the 2020 elections, which Haugen stated \"really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me,\" and which she believed contributed to the 2021 United States Capitol attack. Haugen stated: \"The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook. And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money.\"\r\nHaugen had shared documents with members of the U.S. Congress and offices of various attorneys general, but not with the Federal Trade Commission. Facebook's market capitalization dropped by $6 billion within 24 hours of Haugen's 3 October 60 Minutes interview and after the October 4, 2021 2021 Facebook outage.

Based on the leaked documents, Kevin Roose, writing for The New York Times, suggested Facebook might be a weaker social media company than it previously appeared to be.\r\nAfter Haugen publicly disclosed her identity, Pierre Omidyar's philanthropic organization, Luminate Group, began to provide support to Haugen, including help with press and government relations in Europe.\r\n\r\nSecurities and Exchange Commission complaints\r\nAt least eight complaints were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Haugen's attorneys, covering topics reported by The Wall Street Journal, and including how Facebook deals with political misinformation, hate speech, teenage mental health, human trafficking, the promotion of ethnic violence, preferential treatment of certain users, and its communications with investors. In a SEC whistleblower complaint, Haugen alleged Facebook had misled investors, given that they had misrepresented the progress they had made in tackling hate, violence and misinformation on the platform. The documents provided by Haugen to the SEC also pertained to Facebook's management of election-related misinformation in the United States after the November 2020 election.\r\nHaugen's complaint included internal Facebook documents pertaining to Facebook management of misinformation and hate speech in India. The complaint stated that many users and pages associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) promoted fear-mongering and anti-Muslim narratives, with an intent to incite violence. She alleged that Facebook was well aware of the incendiary anti-Muslim narratives promoted in India. Haugen also asserted that the lack of Hindi and Bengali Facebook classifiers meant that corrective action on problematic posts was often neglected.\r\nPublic statements by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg are referenced in the SEC complaints filed by Haugen, along with her allegation that Zuckerberg is ultimately responsible as CEO, since he controlled Facebook. Various public statements by Zuckerberg, including his 2020 testimony before the U.S. Congress, appear to be inconsistent with internal Facebook documents submitted by Haugen. In February 2022, Whistleblower Aid filed two SEC complaints on behalf of Haugen, alleging \"material misrepresentations and omissions in statements to investors\" by Facebook, related to its efforts to address climate change misinformation and COVID misinformation, based on internal Facebook documents.\r\n\r\nOctober 5, 2021 U.S. Congress testimony\r\nOn October 5, 2021, Haugen testified before the United States Senate Commerce Committee's Sub-Committee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security. A written version of her opening statement to the U.S. Senate subcommittee was published on October 4, 2021. \r\nHaugen stated during the hearing, \"The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people. Congressional action is needed. They won\u2019t solve this crisis without your help.\" Haugen further discussed Myanmar and Ethiopia, stating Facebook is \"literally fanning ethnic violence\" when engagement-based ranking is deployed without functioning integrity and security systems. Haugen also indicated she is in communication with another U.S. congressional committee about issues related to espionage and disinformation, and a reason she has not shared documents with the Federal Trade Commission is because she believes Facebook systems will \"continue to be dangerous even if they're broken up.\" After the hearing, Senator Richard Blumenthal, chair of the Commerce subcommittee, said Haugen \"wants to fix Facebook, not burn it to the ground.\"\r\nIn the wake of Haugen's testimony, the response from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that day included \"Many of the claims don't make any sense. I think most of us just don\u2019t recognize the false picture of the company that is being painted\", and \"We're committed to doing the best work we can, but at some level the right body to assess trade-offs between social equities is our democratically elected Congress.\" A post-hearing statement from Lena Pietsch, Facebook's director of policy communications, included, \"We agree on one thing.

On October 13, 2021, in response to disclosures made by Haugen to The Wall Street Journal, more than a dozen U.S. state attorneys general sent a letter to Facebook requesting information about the Facebook \"XCheck system\" that protects high-profile users and Facebook action against COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.\r\nOn November 12, 2021, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit against Meta Platforms (formerly known as Facebook) on behalf of investors, alleging repeated false representations by executives, including chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, CFO David Wehner, and global affairs and communications executive Nick Clegg, about the safety of the platform, based on documents leaked by Haugen and documents collectively known as \"The Facebook Papers\". The lawsuit seeks over $100 billion in damages and for the company to implement reforms.\r\nOn November 18, 2021, a bipartisan group of state attorneys general announced a consumer protection investigation of Meta based on documents shared by Haugen. The investigation includes a focus on Instagram, how Meta promotes engagement, and possible harms to children and teenagers.\r\n\r\nAdditional actions\r\nOn October 6, 2021, Haugen's attorney John Tye said the legal team and Haugen are in communication with the Federal Trade Commission, as well as the European Parliament and the French Parliament. The United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the United States House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol have confirmed plans to meet with Haugen.\r\nOn October 11, 2021, Facebook's Oversight Board, an external review panel which rules on select content moderation decisions of the company, announced that it would be speaking with Haugen about her experiences with the company and its practices. On October 21, 2021, Haugen met with the U.S. House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee chair David Cicilline and ranking member Ken Buck.\r\nOn October 25, 2021, Haugen testified before the Parliament of the United Kingdom. During her testimony, she advocated for government regulation of Facebook, and for Facebook to make changes.\r\nOn November 8, 2021, she appeared before the European Parliament in a hearing organized by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. In a nearly three-hour hearing, she urged the Parliament debating the Digital Services Act to mandate social media platforms to operate transparently and not to create loopholes that Big Tech could exploit. Haugen said the DSA has \"the potential to be a global gold standard\" and an inspiration for other countries on safeguarding democracy on social media. She emphasized how linguistically diverse Europe could force the platforms to take a systemic approach to safety, rather than focus only on content moderation and on major languages.\r\nOn May 18, 2022, after the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union had reached a political agreement on the Digital Services Act, Haugen reappeared before the Parliament. She congratulated the EU lawmakers for the result and called for the European Commission and the member states to put a lot of effort into enforcing the DSA, so that it will not be \"a dead letter\".\r\nIn June 2022, Politico reported that Haugen plans to establish a non-profit organization called \"Beyond the Screen\" to enhance awareness of the harms of social media. The new organization will focus on litigation and investor-based strategies in order to provide legal and economic incentives for mitigating harms.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 507095, "end_char_idx": 511790, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29b2394d-bcf0-41a1-af49-3ecb142a20df": {"__data__": {"id_": "29b2394d-bcf0-41a1-af49-3ecb142a20df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f002541-1c5a-46bf-979a-054577da1dd8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "0582d04e4e6b91166aeb5d36094f7bebf03cbf575ff6cb5fd9c7b326995f4890", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "74524750-2cd0-4d02-a04a-9fbaeb76fd75", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c42f6b430e0c7af3c8d6852eeb32d9ea4095c872a2d82e27d9686a93afc3a2d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "She emphasized how linguistically diverse Europe could force the platforms to take a systemic approach to safety, rather than focus only on content moderation and on major languages.\r\nOn May 18, 2022, after the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union had reached a political agreement on the Digital Services Act, Haugen reappeared before the Parliament.

In 2023, Haugen's memoir The Power of One: How I Found the Strength to Tell the Truth and Why I Blew the Whistle on Facebook was published by Little, Brown & Company. A review in The Washington Post by Bethany McLean states, \"If all Haugen\u2019s book did was present her whistleblowing case (the legal merits of which have yet to be decided), it might still be an important part of the ongoing chronicling of how we allowed social media's dangers to creep up on us. But what really makes the book worth reading is the broader wisdom in her story (and the absence of the self-importance implied by the book's unfortunate title).\"\r\n\r\nPersonal life\r\nIn 2011, Haugen was diagnosed with celiac disease, and in 2014 while going through a divorce, she had to be hospitalized in intensive care. In 2021, Haugen told The Guardian she was motivated to focus her work at Facebook on addressing misinformation because of her experience with losing a friend, who had been hired to help with household tasks during her recovery, after the friend visited online forums and became a proponent of conspiratorial beliefs that included white nationalism and the occult. After leaving Facebook, Haugen relocated to Puerto Rico, and has invested in a cryptocurrency company.\r\nHaugen has Norwegian ancestry and was awarded an America-Norway Heritage Award from the Norway-America Association in 2022 for her work as a whistleblower.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nChris Hughes\r\nChristopher Wylie \u2013 data consultant who prompted the 2018 Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal\r\nCriticism of Facebook\r\nSean Parker\r\nSophie Zhang (whistleblower) \u2013 former Facebook data analyst and whistleblower\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nExternal links\r\n\r\nOfficial website \r\nAppearances on C-SPAN  \r\nFrances Haugen at IMDb \r\nProtecting Kids Online: Testimony from a Facebook Whistleblower (U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, October 5, 2021)\r\nFacebook Whistleblower Frances Haugen Talking about Facebook Papers December 10, 2021, ZDF Magazin Royale\r\n\r\nTitle: Lauren Klein\r\nLauren Klein is an American academic who works as an associate professor, and director of the Digital Humanities Lab at Emory University. \r\nKlein is best known for her work in digital humanities and for co-authoring the book Data Feminism with Catherine D'Ignazio.\r\n\r\nEarly life and education\r\nKlein studied comparative literature and computer science at Harvard University.

She was able to bond with her father and brother through her admiration for baseball. Along with baseball, she had a love for math and science. Nichols attended Tennessee Tech University to get an undergraduate degree in physics. She later went to Carnegie Mellon University to study computer science as a graduate student.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nEarly career\r\nWhile studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon, Nichols came across Usenet, which is similar to the internet, but in the 1980s. In the network, she started contributing to rec.sport.baseball, a blog-like page on Usenet where baseball analysts from the 1970s-80s discussed new approaches to analyzing the game with one another. Contributors of rec.sport.baseball have become prominent figures in sports analytics, including the main contributors to the first editions of Baseball Prospectus, an organization that posts topics on baseball analytics that is still widely interacted with today. Rec.sport.baseball is where Nichols first realized the importance of overlooked statistics such as on-base percentage that influenced team performance in a baseball game. It was during her rec.sport.baseball days when she created Nichol's Law of Catcher Defense, the first of many physical marks she made on Sabermetrics. Nichol's Law of Catcher Defense states that \"a catcher's defensive reputation is inversely proportional to their offensive abilities.\"\r\n\r\nProject Scoresheet\r\nIn October 1983, an influential baseball statistician by the name of Bill James created Project Scoresheet, which called for a nationwide effort to collect play-by-play baseball data that was not recorded ever before. Seeing this opportunity, Nichols and her husband, David Nichols, volunteered for the Pittsburgh branch to track game data. Working on Project Scoresheet led Sherri and David to start attending annual conventions held by the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), a leading baseball analytics organization where the term \"sabermetrics\" stems from. The annual conventions are where Sherri met Pete DeCoursey, who worked on Project Scoresheet in a different branch. While using the data collected through Project Scoresheet, the two joined heads to create the groundbreaking baseball metric called \"Defensive Average\". Nichols used her computer science background and did all of the software engineering to develop the statistic. Defensive Average is explained as \"the number of balls fielded by a player at a position divided by the number of balls hit to that fielder's zone of responsibility while he's playing that position.\" The new metric allowed for a better way to quantify a player's defensive ability than the lackluster metrics available at the time. With the creation of Defensive Average, many baseball analysts found that previous defensive analysis methods were misleading and flawed. Around the same time she developed Defensive Average, from 1990-1995, Nichols also had a job in Silicon Valley as a software engineer for Adobe. In 1995, when her daughter Susan was born, Nichols gradually removed herself from working on Defensive Average and other baseball analytics topics and passed the torch on to new management.\r\n\r\nRetrosheet\r\nWhile Project Scoresheet was meeting its demise in 1989, a Project Scoresheet alumni and baseball analyst, David Smith, founded Retrosheet. Similar to Project Scoresheet, Retrosheet is a non-profit organization that collects box scores and play-by-play statistics from the entire history of baseball. Nichols was chosen to be the vice president and treasurer of the new organization for her positive influences in Project Scoresheet and the SABR conventions. She held the position at Retrosheet until 2003. In the first board meeting, Nichols revolutionized the way data scientists collected data by making all of Retrosheet's data available for free and open to the public. The reasoning behind it was that money had been an issue that eventually brought Project Scoresheet down, and Nichols believed that sports teams and organizations would be more willing to collaborate with Retrosheet if they weren't asking for their money. As expected, Retrosheet was incredibly successful. Retrosheet has collected data for 182,911 out of the 194,908 MLB games between 1901 and 2018.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 525324, "end_char_idx": 530248, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17ec339c-b368-4faa-a3d3-a4ba5f59cbbf": {"__data__": {"id_": "17ec339c-b368-4faa-a3d3-a4ba5f59cbbf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d64da4b-fb79-4920-9673-b3e3c18970b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "0af10c54e9d33d4d012a84ca531d8f09e2446c2d04f63c2e5b8326051b422c04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4672d90-4f87-4117-88b4-b2829345a74e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eee9a5758e1e9355181609b99d5fc82ed508a8d344fc17ffa8da70dff91bc627", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Similar to Project Scoresheet, Retrosheet is a non-profit organization that collects box scores and play-by-play statistics from the entire history of baseball.

Nichols' work on Retrosheet has directly provided data to well-known databases and baseball analytics organizations such as Baseball-Reference, FanGraphs, and Baseball Prospectus.\r\n\r\nInfluence on analytics industry\r\nDuring her time working on baseball analytics, Nichols only received one offer from a professional baseball team's front office. It was a non-paid job for the Pittsburgh Pirates to collect and analyze data for a short period of time. She decided to turn down the offer, and no other teams reached out to her ever again. Although she did not work for any front office in baseball, she is known to have influenced many data scientists in baseball during the 1980s-1990s. Even as a woman in a male-dominated field such as baseball analytics, Nichols' assertiveness and wealth in knowledge greatly influenced big names in sabermetrics such as Bill James, David Smith, and Gary Huckabay. Her contribution in the industry has also led to an increase in the number of women working in the sports business field.\r\n\r\nCareer post-analytics\r\nSince working in the Retrosheet team, Nichols has not worked in the sports analytics field. She recently stated that she never intended on pursuing baseball analytics as a career, and how it was merely a hobby for her. Currently, Nichols is a part of a truancy board and city planning commission in Redmond, Washington, and works for the American Civil Liberties Union.\r\n\r\nCareer highlights and achievements\r\nNichols' Law of Catcher Defense: \"A catcher's defensive reputation in baseball is inversely proportional to their offensive abilities.\" Nichols came to this conclusion after seeing baseball players such as Mickey Tettleton being regarded as bad defensive players, even though they were previously known to be excellent defensive catchers, solely because they became better hitters.\r\nDefensive Average: \"The number of balls fielded by a player at a position divided by the number of balls hit to that fielder's zone of responsibility while he's playing that position.\" Created solely by Nichols and Pete DeCoursey. Although Defensive Average did have some flaws, it was a top-notch measurement in quantifying a baseball player's defensive ability. Current metrics such as Total Zone and Ultimate Zone Rating is directly modeled off Defensive Average, and they are used today to decide Gold Glove Awards in the MLB.\r\nAssociation for Computing Machinery (ACM) Award (2016): Nichols won the award for helping create the Andrew File System in the 1980s with her husband David Nichols. The system was recognized as the \"first distributed file system designed for tens of thousands of machines\". The file system is still regarded as the largest system ever built and has been used by over 100,000 companies across the world.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nExternal links\r\nRetrosheet\r\n\r\nTitle: Cathy O'Neil\r\nCatherine (\"Cathy\") Helen O'Neil is an American mathematician, data scientist, and author.

Parker is an American biostatistician and data scientist. She was formerly a senior data analyst at the fashion merchandising company Stitch Fix. Parker co-hosts the data analytics podcast Not So Standard Deviations with Roger Peng. She received her PhD in biostatistics from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and has formerly been employed by Etsy.\r\n\r\nLife and education\r\nParker graduated from Pomona College in 2008 with a bachelor's degree in molecular biology and mathematics. After earning her MHS, she obtained her PhD in biostatistics from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2013. Parker resides in San Francisco.\r\nParker's scientific research began during her PhD in the areas of genomics and personalized medicine. Her research looked at factors like batch effects and their impact on prediction. Working alongside Jeffrey T. Leek, Parker developed methods for the application of genomic technologies in personalized medicine. Batch effects confound data produced by genomic sequencing technologies, like microarrays. Parker's work aims at correcting predictions that are influenced by the batch effect. This helps mitigate the effects of confounded genomic data. This is of importance since the data is used for diagnosis. In her dissertation, \"Practical statistical issues in translational genomics,\" Parker proposed frozen surrogate variable analysis (fSVA) to improve prediction accuracy in public genomic studies and simulations.\r\n\r\nCareer and research\r\nAfter her PhD, Parker went on to work as a data scientist in industry. Her first job was as a data analyst (later, senior data analyst) at Etsy, where she worked for approximately three years. Parker self-described her position as an internal statistical consultant, eventually focused on developing A/B testing and other experiments run by the company, along with analyzing the resulting data. Opportunity sizing, experimentation and impact analysis all play a role in how she helped the company development.\r\nIn 2015, Parker began work on the podcast, Not So Standard Deviations, with co-host Roger Peng. The pair discuss data analytics, covering statistical computation, data cleaning, and R packages. The show is among the more popular data science and statistics podcasts, with over half a million downloads. The two also co-authored the book, Conversations on Data Science based on their conversations during the podcast. They recorded their 100th podcast episode live on stage as a keynote presentation at the RStudio-sponsored rstudio::conf 2020.\r\nAfter leaving Etsy, Parker transitioned to a career as a data scientist at personal styling site Stitch Fix. The company employs a human-in-the-loop algorithmic process to generate a recommended box of clothing that is shipped to subscribers. Parker optimizes the algorithms the site uses to recommend clothes to people and helps determine what data is needed from clients to determine clothing matches. She has worked on new forms of data generation and helped build datasets powering outfits. Parker left Stitch Fix in August 2020 to join the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign.\r\nParker speaks at conferences, often as a keynote speaker. She coined the term \"opinionated analysis development\" to describe a framework for producing robust data analysis that resembles some aspects of software design.\r\n\r\nAwards\r\nIn 2012, Parker received the Helen Abbey Award from Johns Hopkins. This award is given to a student who intends to teach biostatistics.\r\n\r\nSelected works\r\nParker has contributed to several different publications and projects including the following:\r\n\r\nLeek, Jeffrey T.; Johnson, W.

Winchell worked at Columbia University for thirty-eight years before retiring in 1962. She is best remembered for producing the seventh and eighth editions of the Guide to Reference Books.  In 1999, American Libraries included Constance Winchell in a list of 100 most influential individuals in the field of library and information science.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nConstance Winchell was born on November 2, 1896. Her family lived in Northampton, Massachusetts.  Tragically, Winchell's father died early, when Constance was only seven years old.  This left her mother as the sole provider for Winchell and her three brothers.  Despite these difficulties, Winchell's education was never jeopardized.\r\nWinchell's family valued learning and education.  Many of her relatives were college graduates and scholars, despite the relative rarity of obtaining an advanced degree in the early twentieth century. Winchell's future career was further influenced by her aunt Mabel Winchell who was a librarian in New Hampshire. Additionally, her mother occasionally rented rooms to lecturers from a local college to support the family. The presence of these educated borders further encouraged the Winchell children to explore the world of ideas and academic pursuits.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nWinchell attended a private high school called the Capen School. Later that year, her family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan. In Ann Arbor, Winchell enrolled in classes at the University of Michigan.  During the summers of her junior and senior years at Michigan, she attended library science lectures, which were conducted by Michigan's library director William Warner Bishop. Winchell earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1918. With Bishop's encouragement, Winchell enrolled in the library school program offered at the New York Public Library the following year. Although the program was two years, the second year was optional. Due to monetary concerns Winchell opted to complete only the first year of the program. She received a certificate in 1920.\r\nIn 1928, after Winchell had accepted a position at Columbia University, she enrolled in Columbia's School of Library Service. Her thesis was called \u201cLocating Books for Interlibrary Loan.\u201d The essay encompassed much of the knowledge that her employer and professor Isadore Gilbert Mudge had acquired while supplying interlibrary loans over the course of her career. Winchell's essay was well received upon its publication in 1930, and was recognized by many librarians to be one of the definitive books on interlibrary loans for many years. Winchell received a master's degree in Library Service in 1930.\r\n\r\nEarly career\r\nWinchell knew early in life that she wanted to become a librarian. Her first library job was obtained in the University of Michigan library during her undergraduate years. She helped to improve the library catalog and provided reference services at some of the departmental libraries. Her first professional job was as the librarian of Duluth Minnesota's Central High School. She also taught ancient history classes while she was employed at Central High. Winchell only held this position for a year, before moving to New York to attend library school.\r\nAfter receiving her Library Science certificate, Winchell took at job with the United States Merchant Marine.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 546871, "end_char_idx": 551305, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd0e2f14-103c-4d45-95ba-7b53861e6c04": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd0e2f14-103c-4d45-95ba-7b53861e6c04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "065f8678-db97-495e-9aed-7fcd5dd55158", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "e47ff60ab3483cf56a994124288375a5f9f7c5bedb06fd2faf9ca31619cea0bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "302e0c56-c92d-4b92-b6d4-b11df6975509", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "09609c693b7101675e0e6db36d58e3c69b3a77066b31789e8a3130f877d43b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Winchell's essay was well received upon its publication in 1930, and was recognized by many librarians to be one of the definitive books on interlibrary loans for many years.

Winchell only held this position for a year, before moving to New York to attend library school.\r\nAfter receiving her Library Science certificate, Winchell took at job with the United States Merchant Marine. This position required Winchell to travel extensively on the coast of the Eastern United States, where she was responsible for creating- and acquiring books for- lighthouse libraries.  This position lasted for five months, at which time Winchell moved back to Ann Arbor to join the University of Michigan library staff. During the three years that Winchell was employed by Michigan she worked in the cataloging department, and later as a reference assistant.  Winchell next accepted a job at the American Library in Paris, France.  Here, she spent a year and a half working as the head catalogue librarian.\r\n\r\nColumbia and later career\r\nIn the autumn of 1925, Winchell returned to the United States to accept a job at the Columbia University Library.  Upon the publication of her master's thesis \u201cLocating Books for Interlibrary Loan\u201d in 1930, Winchell was made responsible for Columbia's interlibrary loans. Three years later, in 1933, Winchell became the assistant reference librarian.  In 1941, Winchell was promoted to the head of reference.  Winchell continued to serve as Columbia's head reference librarian until her retirement on June 30, 1962.\r\nIn 1960 Winchell was the second person to receive the Isadore Gilbert Mudge Citation for Distinguished Contributions to Reference Librarianship. The award was presented by the American Library Association's Reference Service Division. This accolade was bestowed upon Winchell as a result of her work developing Columbia's reference collection and for her 1930 thesis book \u201cLocating Books for Interlibrary Loan.\u201d \r\nWinchell contributed to the library profession in other ways. She taught library science classes while working at Columbia. She was an active member of the American Library Association for many years, eventually obtaining membership on the organization's council; and she wrote semi-annual articles for College & Research Libraries, the first of which appeared in 1951.\r\n\r\nThe Guide to Reference Books\r\nWinchell is best remembered for publishing the seventh and eighth editions of the Guide to Reference Books.  The Guide to Reference Books was a bibliography of more than 8,000 books that was an important resource for developing the reference collections of many libraries. The books included in the Guide were about many different subjects, and they were in a variety of languages. The first edition of the Guide was published by Alice Bertha Kroeger in 1902. After publishing a second edition, Kroeger bequeathed the project to Isadore Gilbert Mudge. Mudge was responsible for producing the third through the sixth editions of the Guide to Reference Books. She also produced five supplements to each edition, which were published in Library Journal.  Mudge was Constance Winchell's boss, professor, and colleague at Columbia University.  Beginning with one of the supplements to the fifth edition, Winchell helped Mudge to edit the Guide. When Mudge retired in 1941, her position as Columbia's head reference librarian was vacated. Winchell was promoted to this position, and she assumed editorship of the Guide to Reference Books at the same time.\r\nWinchell edited and published the seventh edition of the Guide in 1951. This edition expanded the book in many subjects, but most apparently in \u201cpsychology, fine arts, and history.\u201d  She produced four supplements to the seventh edition, which appeared in 1954, 1956, 1960, and 1963. The eighth edition was published in 1967, five years after Winchell's official retirement from Columbia University.  The eighth edition further expanded the contents of the Guide; it included 2,000 new books. Winchell also reorganized the structure of the Guide to include five general subject areas, as opposed to the thirteen areas included in earlier editions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 550386, "end_char_idx": 555074, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "302e0c56-c92d-4b92-b6d4-b11df6975509": {"__data__": {"id_": "302e0c56-c92d-4b92-b6d4-b11df6975509", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd0e2f14-103c-4d45-95ba-7b53861e6c04", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "4a881af4c7a4ff23ddba2463e53b7aad878952fa7dd7ae5a16d5764f03649882", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "005ee353-b6c7-4937-a59f-36d2236a7952", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe6f3d5246240f349758da4e9b618ee352d7428694ea6d867388bca7fda43f00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "When Mudge retired in 1941, her position as Columbia's head reference librarian was vacated.

In the 1960s Winchell's name became synonymous with the Guide, and librarians frequently referred to the book as \u201cWinchell.\u201d  Furthermore, the changes that Winchell made to the guide would impact \u201ctwo generations of reference [librarians].\u201d\r\n\r\nLater life\r\nAs early as 1924, when she accepted the cataloging position in the American library in Paris, Winchell recognized a desire to travel. But she was not able to indulge in this passion until late in her career, and after her retirement from Columbia. Not long before retiring, she took a four-month leave from Columbia to travel extensively through Asia.\r\nShe also visited such disparate foreign lands as Central and South America, the Middle East, and India.\r\nIn 1969 Winchell moved to New Paltz, New York. Winchell continued to reside in New Paltz until her death on May 23, 1983 at the age of 86.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nExternal links\r\nConstance Mabel Winchell at Find a Grave\r\n\r\nTitle: Matthew J. Baggott\r\nMatthew John Baggott, PhD is an American neuroscientist who studies entactogens, hallucinogens, and other psychoactive drugs. He is considered to be an expert on MDMA and other entactogens and is an influential figure in the psychedelic medicine movement.\r\nBaggott is co-founder and CEO of Tactogen, a public benefit corporation started in 2020 that is developing novel MDMA-like drugs as medicines. Baggott had previously worked with the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) studying and developing MDMA as a potential medicine. He had also formerly worked in a research lab at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) affiliated with Alexander Shulgin and Peyton Jacob III, and became well-acquainted with Shulgin while in the lab. Baggott was involved in the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved clinical studies of MDMA and MDA. He has been active in scientific research since the 1980s and has been studying MDMA since that time. Baggott was also previously a data scientist and then director of data science and engineering at Genentech. He earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago and his doctorate degree in neuroscience from UCSF.\r\nIn January 14, 2022, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) proposed moving five unscheduled and relatively obscure psychedelic tryptamines, including 4-OH-DiPT, 5-MeO-AMT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DET, and DiPT, into the Schedule I controlled substances category in the United States. Baggott and Tactogen, as well as a large number of other individuals and organizations, publicly challenged and opposed the proposal.

He has worked with Ben Rubin, founder of EAR Studio and now with the New School. Hansen's collaborative work has been on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid, Science Museum, London, the Cartier Foundation in Paris, the Whitney Museum, La Panac\u00e9e in Montpellier, the San Jose Museum of Art, and is permanently exhibited in the lobbies of the New York Times Building and the Public Theater.\r\n\r\nListening Post\r\nListening Post is a visual and auditory art exhibit made by Mark Hansen and Ben Rubin. Through machine learning techniques, fragments of conversations from chatrooms and forums across the Internet are displayed and read aloud in real time. The piece opened at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, but has been displayed all over the world. Listening Post received the 2004 Golden Nica for Interactive Art from Ars Electronica, and copies have been acquired by the San Jose Museum of Art and Science Museum, London.\r\n\r\nMoveable Type\r\nMark Hansen and Ben Rubin were partners in the creation of Moveable Type, on display in the lobby of the New York Times building in midtown Manhattan from November of 2007. This piece builds off of \u201cListening Post,\u201d displaying choreographed patterns of words and phrases in real time from data produced by the New York Times. Moveable Type assembles a database consisting of articles from the first newspaper in 1851 to the present day, specialty collections of Times' content including the crossword puzzles and the recipes, and Web commentaries from Times' readers. The piece then creates choreographed displays of data, divided into scenes, each scene devoted to some aspect of the day's news.\r\n\r\nShakespeare Machine\r\nBen Rubin, Mark Hansen, Jer Thorp, Michele Gorman. \r\nHansen collaborated with Ben Rubin, Jer Thorp and Michele Gorman for the Shakespeare Machine project in 2012. Over the bar in the center of the lobby of the Public Theater in New York City, the team constructed a chandelier, a digital display consisting of 37 LED panels, one for each of Shakespeare's plays. The piece finds and displays phrases from Shakespeare\u2019s work that share common rhetorical structures.\r\n\r\nShuffle and A Sort of Joy\r\nHansen and Rubin collaborated with the Elevator Repair Service and Rebecca Mead to create the theatrical performance Shuffle drawing from the texts of The Great Gatsby, The Sun Also Rises, and The Sound and the Fury, each used previously as a script for an ERS production. Shuffle debuted at the New York Public Library. As the Office for Creative Research, Thorp, Hansen and Rubin produced a second piece with the Elevator Repair Service through the Museum of Modern Art's Artist's Experiments Program. Using MoMA's collections database, A Sort of Joy (Thousands of Exhausted Things) was performed in the museum's second floor galleries. ERS actors received randomized scripts drawn from the titles, artist names, materials and dimensions of the artworks in MoMA's collection.\r\n\r\nTimescape\r\nHansen collaborated with Ben Rubin, Jer Thorp, and Local Projects to create Timescape, an installation in the 9/11 memorial museum. The installation pulls articles from over 100 news sources to create an ever-evolving timeline of the social, cultural, political and economic impacts of the 9/11 attacks that are still felt today.\r\n\r\nThe Brain Index\r\nThe Brain Index was a collaboration between Hansen and Laura Kurgan of the Center for Spatial Research at Columbia University. It allowed users to interact with data about the human brain, distributed across many large scale displays.\r\n\r\nJournalistic work\r\nHansen's art work and journalistic work often intersect. In 2010, Hansen collaborated with Jer Thorp and Jake Porway to create Project Cascade, a tool to visualize connections between articles shared on Twitter.

A documentary by the same title complements the book. In addition to authoring articles about climate change, he is the founder of the website noflyclimatesci.org and co-founder of the app, Earth Hero: Climate Change.\r\n\r\nEducation and early career\r\nKalmus attended Harvard University, where he received his Bachelor of Science in physics in 1997.  At Harvard, he used Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy to discover and categorize the quantum-mechanical rotational spectra of several cyanopolyynes which were subsequently found in interstellar clouds. He then taught high school physics in Massachusetts and wrote software in New York City. In 2004 he enrolled in graduate school at Columbia University and received his PhD in physics in 2008. His PhD work involved searching for gravitational waves as a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (thesis: \"Gravitational Waves Associated with Soft Gamma Repeater Flares\"). He continued his work with LIGO as a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology, leading major full-collaboration searches for gravitational waves from magnetars, gamma ray bursts and supernovae and contributing to the precise calibration of the world's gravitational wave observatories.\r\n\r\nResearch\r\nAfter focusing on LIGO related work for several years, Kalmus's focus transitioned into earth and climate science.  Kalmus's recent research centers on cloud physics, specifically improving basic understanding of marine stratocumulus clouds and severe convective weather such as tornadoes with the goal of improving projections of how these phenomena will change as the planet heats, using remote sensing data, in situ data, and models. Marine stratocumulus clouds reflect incoming sunlight, cooling the planet, and are difficult to model accurately in climate models; this makes them a major source of uncertainty in climate projections.\r\nA common thread in his research is improving the utility of satellite observations of the Earth. His work on severe weather unlocks the potential of polar orbiting satellites to observe rapidly changing convective environments by using air parcel trajectory modeling to span the temporal gap between satellite overpass and convective initiation. He has used in situ data from a ship-based campaign to bias-correct the CloudSat warm rain retrieval. He also uses in situ data to validate retrievals from the AIRS instrument on the Aqua (satellite).\r\nRecently, Kalmus has begun to work in the nascent field of ecological forecasting.

He is the principal investigator on a NASA grant to study the projected future of the world's coral reefs with greater accuracy and higher resolution. Coral reefs are rapidly succumbing to ocean heat waves and ocean acidification.\r\nHe has co-authored over 100 peer-reviewed scientific articles in physics and Earth science, with a majority having come from his previous participation in the LIGO Collaboration.\r\n\r\nActivism and public engagement\r\nKalmus is a science communicator whose efforts center on shifting culture away from fossil fuel acceptability. He tweets as @ClimateHuman and as of April 2022 is the most-followed climate scientist on Twitter. He focuses in particular on encouraging the Earth science and other academic communities to speak out with greater urgency on the need for climate action.\r\nHe has been featured in many media outlets, including Mother Jones, PRI's The World, CBC Radio, Deutsche Welle, BuzzFeed, The Intercept, and Quartz, and most often speaks to the need for an immediate and massive climate mobilization and how individuals can \"vote\" for this mobilization through their actions, via both activism and emissions reduction. He frequently speaks to the need for a carbon fee and dividend policy as part of the mobilization, in which fossil fuel becomes increasingly costly as the carbon fee rises every year and 100% of the net revenue is returned equitably to the people, making the policy fiscally progressive.\r\nKalmus lives on approximately one-tenth the fossil fuel of the average American. He says this has made his life more satisfying and meaningful. In 2010, Kalmus realized the flying in planes accounted for roughly 3\u20444 of his greenhouse gas emissions, and he has not flown on a plane since 2012. Kalmus believes that anyone can contribute to cultural shift by conspicuously modeling the change that needs to happen. He has stated that by \"walking the talk\" his advocacy has become more effective.\r\nKalmus is a columnist and regular contributor at YES! magazine. His writing has also appeared in The Guardian, Eos, The Washington Post, and Grist.\r\nOn September 14, 2019, Kalmus tweeted \"Never give up\" and referenced his latest article, \"How to live with the climate crisis without becoming a nihilist\".\r\nKalmus has been associated with the Movement for a People's Party, a progressive organization positioned as an alternative to the Democratic or Republican Party. After the first presidential debate of the 2020 election, Kalmus participated in a four-person response to the debate.\r\nIn late\u20112021, Kalmus likened his own experiences pushing for greater recognition of the climate problem with those of the two fictional astronomers portrayed in the comedy film Don't Look Up.  He also compares absurd events in that film with a series of equally absurd and elusory events in our own world.\r\nKalmus, along with other climate activists, chained himself to the main doors of the Charlotte Douglas International Airport private jet terminal on November 10, 2022. He was charged with trespassing.\r\nIn December 2022, Kalmus and climate scientist Rose Abramoff briefly showed a banner at the eve of a plenary session of the American Geophysical Union's annual Fall Meeting with a call for scientists to engage in protest against climate change: \" Out of the lab and into the streets \u00bb . AGU removed their research presentations from the meeting, banned them from participation, launched a misconduct inquiry, and complained to Abramoff's employer, Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Kalmus and Abramoff further claimed that AGU threatened to have them arrested if they returned to the meeting. Abramoff was subsequently fired by Oak Ridge. In January 2023, 1500 scientists signed an appeal to object to what happened to their colleagues.\r\n\r\nJP Morgan Chase building arrest\r\nOn April 6, 2022, Kalmus was arrested, along with a physicist, an engineer and a science teacher, for chaining himself to the door of the JP Morgan Chase building in Los Angeles, protesting the bank's investments in new fossil fuel projects. Writing in The Guardian in April 2022, Kalmus advocated civil disobedience following the release of the final IPCC Working Group III report.

His two sons have been regularly school striking on Fridays since 2018 as part of the Fridays for Future movement.\r\n\r\nEarth Hero\r\nTo help users track carbon emissions, Kalmus co-founded the smart phone app Earth Hero. It aims to help users reduce their emissions, shift culture with their reductions, and engage in other forms of climate activism such as protest and civil disobedience.\r\n\r\nAwards and recognition\r\nKalmus has won numerous awards both for his science and activism. He received the NASA Early Career Achievement Medal and three Jet Propulsion Laboratory Voyager Awards for his work in Earth science. He is also a recipient of the inaugural Transition US Walking the Talk award. He is a 2018 \"Grist 50\" fellow, one of the ten 2018 fellows classified as \"Visionaries\".\r\nHis book, Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution won an IPPY Outstanding Book of the Year Award, the Nautilus Book Award, and the Foreword Indies Book Award.\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: John Kelly (runner)\r\nJohn Wade Kelly (born November 19, 1984) is an American endurance athlete who specializes in ultrarunning.\r\nHis fastest known times include that for the 268-mile Pennine Way, set in 2021.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nKelly was raised in Morgan County, Tennessee. He was a good but not outstanding runner in high school, after which he did not compete in the sport for several years until 2013, when he ran the Marine Corps Marathon. After subsequently qualifying for the Boston Marathon, he decided to use ultramarathons and triathlons to maintain his fitness and motivation.\r\n\r\nAmerican ultras and triathlons\r\nIn 2017, Kelly became the fifteenth finisher in the history of the Barkley Marathons. He completed the required five loops in a total time of 59:30:53, around half an hour inside the time limit for the full course. It was his third attempt at the race, having managed three loops in 2015 and four in 2016. Later in 2017, Kelly won the Road Runners Club of America National Ultra Championship at the Lookout Mountain 50 Miler.\r\nThe next year, he set a course record of 23:48:00 at the Wild Oak Trail Run in Virginia and was an age group champion at the ITU Long Distance Triathlon World Championships. Thereafter, Kelly became a professional triathlete for just one race, Ironman Arizona, before turning his attention more closely to ultrarunning.\r\nHe won the Franklins 200 Mile race in Texas in February 2019 in a time of 60:53:12.\r\n\r\nBritish races and records\r\nSoon after his Franklins win, Kelly moved with his family to the UK, and in late May 2019, he began an attempt at what he termed the Grand Round. This involved consecutively running the three best-known fell running rounds (the Paddy Buckley in Wales, the Bob Graham in England and the Ramsay in Scotland) and getting between them by cycling.

On this occasion, Kelly was able to complete the Paddy Buckley Round, cycle to Keswick, and finish the Bob Graham Round. He then began the cycling section towards Fort William, but safety concerns relating to tiredness led him to abandon the challenge.\r\nIn January 2020, Kelly took first place at the Spine Race, the route of which largely follows the Pennine Way. He completed the course of approximately 268 miles (431 km) in a time of 87:53. Late in the race, he was challenged by Jayson Cavill, but Cavill was forced to drop out due to tendonitis and Kelly was ultimately left with a comfortable margin of victory.\r\nKelly revisited the Pennine Way in July the same year. With more daylight and the expectation of better weather than in the Spine Race, as well as not having to carry as much equipment, he aimed to beat Mike Hartley\u2019s 1989 record of 65:20. Despite losing time against his schedule in the second half of the run, Kelly was fast enough to set a new record of 64:46. He ran the route in the south to north direction, from Edale to Kirk Yetholm, in contrast to Hartley's north to south traverse. Although Hartley's best had stood for over thirty years, Kelly's record of 64:46 only lasted eight days until it was beaten by Damian Hall who completed the Way in 61:35.\r\nIn August 2020, Kelly returned to the Grand Round, which involves a running distance of about 185 miles (298 km) with around 25,440 metres (83,460 ft) of elevation gain, as well as over 400 miles (640 km) of cycling. He finished the route in a total time of 130:43. This was the first time that the Grand Round had been completed. In 1990, Mike Hartley had run the three rounds in a total time from start to finish of 86:20, but he had used motorized transport between the rounds rather than cycling. Due to the connections with Hartley, Kelly referred to the Pennine Way run and the Grand Round collectively as the Hartley Slam.\r\nKelly made a further attempt on the Pennine Way in May 2021, hoping to avoid the gastrointestinal problems which had restricted him the previous year. This time he ran the Way from north to south, as Hartley and Hall had done on their record runs. Despite periods of heavy rain, Kelly finished the 260 miles (420 km) in a time of 58:04, reducing the record by over three hours.\r\nIn July 2021, Kelly set out to run a circuit of the 214 Wainwrights in the Lake District but foot problems and high temperatures caused an end to the undertaking. Shortly before returning to the United States, he attempted the Wainwrights a second time in May 2022 and completed the whole route in a record time of 5 days, 12 hours, 14 minutes, beating the previous record set by Sabrina Verjee by 11 hours and 35 minutes.\r\n\r\nReturn to the US\r\nKelly was tenth man in the Hardrock 100 in 2022. Later in the year, in a change to his accustomed distance and terrain, he ran a time of 2:26:50 at the California International Marathon.\r\nIn March 2023 Kelly finished the Barkley Marathons with a time of 58:42:23 for a second time. In March 2024 Kelly became the second three-time finisher of the Barkley Marathons with a time of 59:15:38. He is the third person to complete the course more than once.\r\n\r\nData science career\r\nKelly has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and machine learning from Carnegie Mellon.

He was also the Founder and Chairman of the Cheeky Lads Banter Club, a Massachusetts-based think tank before its dissolution in 2021. In December 2022, McElwee announced he would resign from the firm amidst allegations of artificially manipulating the results of polls and his close ties to accused fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried.\r\n\r\nEarly life and education\r\nMcElwee was raised in Ledyard, Connecticut. He attended The King's College, a Christian college in New York City, and holds a master's degree in quantitative Methods for social science from Columbia University.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nAfter graduating from college, he briefly worked for the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank. McElwee later became a researcher for the progressive think tank Demos.\r\n\r\nPolitical activism and journalism\r\nMcElwee began his journalistic career as an intern at CBS News and at Salon, and has since contributed to a variety of publications. Articles by McElwee include pieces where advocated in favor of the Abolish ICE movement in The New York Times.\r\nMcElwee gained national attention in 2018 for his support for the Abolish ICE movement. McElwee is an advocate of left-wing primary challenges to moderate Democrats. In 2020, McElwee reportedly pushed the Justice Democrats to spend money on Cori Bush's campaign against Lacy Clay.\r\nMcElwee had close ties to Sam Bankman-Fried, a former cryptocurrency billionaire, who has since been convicted of fraud. McElwee conducted polling for a Super PAC controlled by Bankman-Fried that was described as a \"political strategy designed to shield crypto from government oversight.\" Additionally, he has been described by Politico as a leading figure for helping Bankman-Fried make straw donations.\r\n\r\nData for Progress\r\n\r\nIn 2018, McElwee became the founding executive director Data for Progress (DFP), a progressive think tank and polling firm. The firm was credited by The Atlantic for releasing one of the first reports on the Green New Deal, and one independent analysis found that Data for Progress was the most accurate pollster in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.\r\nPolling and analysis from Data for Progress has been regularly cited by the Biden administration, and McElwee's tweets were noted for being frequently retweeted by White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain. Following the 2022 midterms, it was reported that McElwee was gambling on election results on the site PredictIt, which raised ethical concerns. According to New York Magazine, McElwee had bet $20,000 on PredictIt that Joe Biden would win the 2020 presidential election.\r\nMcElwee left the firm in November 2022 amidst allegations of gambling on election results and artificially manipulating polling results to affect races that he had bet money on. Additionally, it has been reported McElwee had inquired among his employees about having them participate in an illegal straw donor scheme. Senior members of Data for Progress informed McElwee that they would resign en masse, if he did not step down as the firm's executive director. In a statement reported by Puck, McElwee said he would start a new organization in support of implementing the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Wes McKinney\r\nWes McKinney is an American software developer and businessman.

In addresses to the public, Patil explained: \"The mission of the U.S. Chief Data Scientist, simply put, is to responsibly unleash the power of data to benefit all Americans.\" He added that his team's priority was to do so by creating data.\r\nIn a memorandum on February 20, 2015, entitled \u201cUnleashing the Power of Data to Serve the American People\u201d, Patil outlined his goals as Chief Data Scientist: \r\n\r\nProviding vision on how to provide a maximum social return on federal data.\r\nCreating nationwide data policies that enable shared services and forward-leaning practices to advance our nation's leadership in the data age.\r\nWorking with agencies to establish best practices for data management and ensure the long-term sustainability of databases.\r\nRecruiting and retaining the best minds in data science for public service to address these data science objectives and act as conduits among the government, academia, and industry.\r\nIn his tenure, Patil helped launch the White House's Police Data Initiative as well as the White House's Data-Driven Justice Initiative, collecting data on police activities, and worked on the Precision Medicine Initiative, aiming to build the largest database on genetic information.\r\n\r\nLaw Enforcement\r\nIn 2015, President Obama initiated The President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing in response to the Ferguson shootings in 2014.

Disorganized datasets had prevented accurate assessments. Patil proposed that this was due to the absence of a dedicated technician whose purpose is to organize the data. Efforts were taken to improve coding abilities of police superintendents and homogenizing organization across the 18,000 jurisdictions on board.\r\nMore than 170 datasets were released at the start of the initiative in 2015.\r\n\r\nData-Driven Justice Initiative\r\nWith open police data, Patil saw that data helped track law enforcement actions\u2019 disproportionate interactions with minorities, the poor and those with mental health concerns. In a memorandum to the American people, Patil said, \u201cif all the data from law enforcement were effectively captured, analyzed, and shared, imagine how the effective and analysis of data could advance proven reforms, increase efficiency, and prevent injustice.\u201d. Efforts to decrease the injustice is considered the Data-Driven Justice Initiative (DDJ). \r\nDDJ aimed to help governments from the county to the state level to filter low-level offenders and those with mental illness from higher level offenders and the criminal system at large. Changing the approach to pre-trial incarceration would allow low-risk offenders to shorten jail time especially if they cannot afford bail.\r\nAt its start in 2015, more than 91 million people are covered by the DDJ.\r\n\r\nMedicine\r\nPrecision Medicine Initiative\r\nPatil had a special interest in using data to improve the medical field by way of the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI). PMI aimed to build the largest database of genomic information to increase understanding of cancer treatments, chronic disease, and rare diseases \r\nThe initiative was started as there is not a current dataset in which analyses and correlations can be made across gender and ethnic diversities. This would help with curing diseases but also understand the health of the general population. Patil had often stated that it would be helpful because one may very well be able to see what diseases are not actually rare, but very common. A key issue in PMI that Patil worked on was of trust.\r\nConsidering vulnerability and the issue of ethics that arises in pursuing an initiative PMI, Patil sought to develop workshops and \u201clistening sessions\u201d to hear specific concerns regarding the initiative. Based on the feedback, Patil devised the \u201cprivacy and trust principles.\u201d\r\nThe first principle in its section entitled \u201cData Sharing, Access, and Use\u201d, is that \u201cdata access, use, and sharing should be permitted for authorized purposes only.\"\r\nConcerned with maintaining these principles grew for the future as Patil addressed concerns about the effect of American Healthcare Act (AHCA) on contributions to PMI. He feared that, with the AHCA, people will be scared to donate their genomic information because it will expose pre-existing conditions. While there are protections in place to secure data privacy such as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) instilled in 2008, Patil expressed a worry that the Act would not be heeded.\r\n\r\n2017\u2013present\r\nPatil was a member of the National Infrastructure Advisory Council before resigning in August 2017.\r\nIn October 2017, it was reported that Patil had joined the executive team of Devoted Health.

He is the founder and president of KDnuggets, a discussion and learning website for Business Analytics, Data Mining and Data Science.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nA Jewish refugee from Soviet Union, Gregory Piatetsky was born in Moscow, Russia to Inna Mogilevskaya and mathematician Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro. He was admitted in 1970 to Physics-Mathematics School no. 2, a leading math school in Moscow.\r\nIn March 1974, Piatetsky emigrated to Israel with his family, studying mathematics and computer science at Tel Aviv University for one semester at Technion. He subsequently earned MS (1979) and Ph.D. (1984) degrees from NYU Courant Institute.\r\nIn 1984, his first paper was published in SIGMOD, proving that secondary index selection is NP-complete by reducing it to a set cover problem. In his dissertation, he proved that the greedy method for set cover has a lower bound of 1 - 1/e ~ 63% of the optimal.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nHe joined GTE Laboratories, where he worked on intelligent interfaces relating to databases. In 1989, he proposed a new project at GTE called \"Knowledge Discovery in Databases\". The project created advanced prototypes, including KEFIR (Key Findings Reporter), a system for analysis and summarization of key changes in large databases, which was a forerunner of systems like Google Analytics Intelligence. A KEFIR prototype was applied to GTE health care data and received GTE's highest technical award.\r\nIn 1997, he left GTE to join Knowledge Stream Partners (KSP), where he was Director and later Vice President and Chief Scientist. In April 2000, KSP was acquired by Xchange, Inc., where Piatetsky served as VP and Chief Scientist.\r\nPiatetsky left Xchange in May 2001 to become a self-employed consultant and focus on KDnuggets.\r\n\r\nKDD and SIGKDD\r\nIn 1989, Piatetsky organized the first workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD-89), held at IJCAI-1989 in Detroit, MI. This workshop had over 60 attendees, including researchers Ross Quinlan and Jaime Carbonell.\r\nPiatetsky organized the next two KDD workshops, in 1991 and 1993. With Usama Fayyad and Ramasamy (Sam) Uthurusamy, he expanded the workshops into an annual international conference on Data Mining and was the General Chair of the KDD-98 conference. He served as the chair of the KDD Steering committee until 1998, when the SIGKDD group was formed as part of ACM to run the annual KDD conference and help promote research in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. He  served as Director of SIGKDD for 2001\u20132005 and as SIGKDD Chair for 2005\u20132009.\r\nIn 1997, Piatetsky and Ismail Parsa initiated the KDD Cup competition, which was the world's first open data mining contest.\r\nThe annual ACM SIGKDD conference is the leading research conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, according to Microsoft Academic search and Google Scholar. The 21st ACM SIGKDD conference was held in Sydney, Australia in August 2015.\r\n\r\nKDnuggets\r\nIn 1993, Piatetsky started Knowledge Discovery Nuggets (KDnuggets) as a newsletter to connect researchers who attended the KDD-93 workshop. With the emergence of the Internet and Mosaic, he and Chris Matheus eventually created the website: Knowledge Discovery Mine, hosted at GTE Labs. The newsletter served as an unofficial publication of KDD workshops. When Piatetsky left GTE Labs, he created the KDnuggets website, with the mission of covering the field with short, concise \"nuggets\".", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 622022, "end_char_idx": 625949, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5538e4ab-c332-47ab-99dc-9bd2ec047518": {"__data__": {"id_": "5538e4ab-c332-47ab-99dc-9bd2ec047518", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "29df9c19-d56d-451e-b1b8-6d5dea843efb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "41a4946072d660d634db307a9b9bdfe999e002ed6442ef66a6a24e809d944432", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1656c623-aa61-4da7-b147-500f429c25c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d333be09cdbc103a5353581ebbedcd1052f7cbcfa4f4f0c86f252d01843808f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The annual ACM SIGKDD conference is the leading research conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, according to Microsoft Academic search and Google Scholar.

He serves as head of data science with Blue Rose Research in New York City, and is a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress Action Fund. Shor describes himself as a socialist and advised a number of liberal political action committees during the 2020 United States elections.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nShor grew up in Miami, Florida, in a Sephardic Jewish family of Moroccan origins. He holds a mathematics degree from Florida International University. Shor was a precocious child and gifted in mathematics, starting his undergraduate degree at the age of 13 and finishing at the age of 17. Shor was awarded the Math in Moscow scholarship in fall 2009.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nShor joined the Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign at the age of 20, working on the Chicago-based team that tracked internal and external polls and developed forecasts. The team Shor worked with developed a polling forecasting model, known as \"The Golden Report\", that projected Obama's vote share within one percentage point in eight of the nine battleground states. New York Magazine described Shor as the \"in-house Nate Silver\" of the Obama campaign.\r\n\r\nShor then worked as a senior data scientist with Civis Analytics in Chicago for seven years, where he operated the company's web-based survey. On May 28, 2020, Shor tweeted a summary of an academic study by Omar Wasow, a black political scientist at Princeton University, that argued riots following Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination likely tipped the 1968 presidential election in Richard Nixon's favor. Some critics argued that Shor's tweet, which was posted during the height of the George Floyd protests, could be interpreted as criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement. Jonathan Chait wrote in New York Magazine that \"At least some employees and clients on Civis Analytics complained that Shor's tweet threatened their safety.\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 628599, "end_char_idx": 632313, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de446c5b-eaa4-4003-821d-00f8182809ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "de446c5b-eaa4-4003-821d-00f8182809ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1656c623-aa61-4da7-b147-500f429c25c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "6aae570040a9f37b83d90492c94141366cf37138b30ecdc6ad294aa25c4fe8f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "74f19bbd-358f-41c4-bf9f-c3f81ce4152a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f13479d539e25f76d632873e577b3a6bcd57777b8d808f4c8f2492ec37089e4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "New York Magazine described Shor as the \"in-house Nate Silver\" of the Obama campaign.\r\n\r\nShor then worked as a senior data scientist with Civis Analytics in Chicago for seven years, where he operated the company's web-based survey.

Shor is an advocate for what he terms \"popularism\", the idea that Democrats should campaign on a strategy of focusing on issues that enjoy electoral popularity, such as focusing on economic issues over polarizing social and cultural issues.

He has worked as a New York Times op-ed contributor, a data scientist at Google, as well as a visiting lecturer at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He has published research using Google Trends search data, as well as data from Wikipedia and Facebook, to gain real-time insights into people's thoughts and beliefs that they may be unwilling to admit publicly.\r\nHis first book Everybody Lies was published by HarperCollins in 2017. The book subsequently became a New York Times bestseller, and was named a book of the year by both PBS NewsHour and the Economist.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nStephens-Davidowitz was born on September 15, 1982, in Englewood, New Jersey into a Jewish family, son of Esther Davidowitz and Mitchell Stephens. He grew up in Alpine, New Jersey, and attended Tenafly High School in Tenafly, graduating in 1999. He went on to earn his B.A. in philosophy from Stanford University before enrolling at Harvard University, where he received a Ph.D. in economics in 2013.\r\n\r\nEverybody Lies\r\nEverybody Lies was published by HarperCollins in 2017. The book has received several reviews and other coverage, was a New York Times bestseller, and was named a book of the year by both PBS NewsHour and the Economist.\r\nThe overriding theme of the book is that people aren't as honest about their true natures when responding to standard questionnaires as they are when searching the internet, on the assumption that search is a private activity. Of particular note is the empirical chapter, Chapter 4: Digital Truth Serum, derived from extensive Big Data analysis of search engine search histories (primarily Google's) on sensitive subject matters such as prejudice, violence, and sexuality. The remainder of the book addresses the surrounding issues of methodology, epistemology, and moral philosophy.\r\nIn 2022, Stephens-Davidowitz published another book, Don't Trust Your Gut: Using Data to Get What You Really Want in Life.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 631483, "end_char_idx": 635982, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74f19bbd-358f-41c4-bf9f-c3f81ce4152a": {"__data__": {"id_": "74f19bbd-358f-41c4-bf9f-c3f81ce4152a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "de446c5b-eaa4-4003-821d-00f8182809ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "abef433e85abcbd98a7094bbb3b67546253ca77823639aead22fbd62fc517830", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "27751ab4-7c47-4a80-807f-fa04ee853659", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3a54963f814a1f2e0cde61716767b720ebca2f911c0c1d0b277c731fb9e36e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "in economics in 2013.\r\n\r\nEverybody Lies\r\nEverybody Lies was published by HarperCollins in 2017.

Stern Endowed Professor of Business at New York University's Stern School of Business. He also serves as the Dean of Computer Science at the University of the People on the pro bono basis.\r\nProfessor Tuzhilin is known for his work on personalization, recommender systems, machine learning and AI, where he has made several contributions, including being instrumental in developing the area of Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARS), proposing novel methods of providing unexpected and cross-domain recommendations based on the principles of deep-learning, developing novel approaches to customer segmentation, and discovery of unexpected patterns in data.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nTuzhilin received his B.A. in Mathematics from the New York University in 1980, M.S. in Engineering Economics from the Department of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University in 1981, and Ph.D. in computer science from NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1989, his doctoral advisor being Zvi Kedem.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nTuzhilin joined the faculty at the New York University Stern School of Business in 1989 as an Assistant Professor of Information Systems. He is currently the Leonard N. Stern Professor of Business. He is also the Dean of Computer Science at the University of the People.\r\n\r\nResearch\r\nTuzhilin researches data mining in databases, personalization, recommender systems, and customer relationship management.\r\nIn 2006, Tuzhilin was hired by Google and given access to its monitoring systems to do a study on click fraud. This was part of a class-action settlement requiring Google to offer advertisers up to $60 million in refunds. Tuzhilin concluded that defining and tracking click fraud will be difficult, because it is often not possible to decipher whether Web surfers were clicking on an advertising link out of malice or as part of an innocent online excursion.\r\n\r\nPatents\r\nIn 2001, Tuzhilin patented a method of building customer profiles and using them to recommend products and services. Tuzhilin said of the patent, 'It's very broad and very general, and occupies some prime real estate in this space. It essentially covers technologies that are crucial for implementation of customer relationship management.' He added that the patent was careful not to stipulate that the technology was designed for Internet applications. Others pointed out that there were legal exceptions to business methods patents. Any individuals or companies that can show they have been engaged in a business practice for at least a year before a patent application for that practice was filed may be able to circumvent the patent.\r\nIn March 2012, Yahoo sued Facebook for violating 10 of its patents. Facebook countersued Yahoo, claiming that it violated Facebook patents that covered 80% of the Yahoo's 2011 revenues. Three of Facebook's patents were originally granted to Tuzhilin.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nExternal links\r\nAlexander Tuzhilin publications indexed by Google Scholar \r\nAlexander Tuzhilin at the Mathematics Genealogy Project\r\n\r\nTitle: Dan Wagner (data scientist)\r\nDan Wagner served as chief analytics officer on Barack Obama's 2012 election campaign and is the founder of Civis Analytics.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 635014, "end_char_idx": 639787, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27751ab4-7c47-4a80-807f-fa04ee853659": {"__data__": {"id_": "27751ab4-7c47-4a80-807f-fa04ee853659", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "74f19bbd-358f-41c4-bf9f-c3f81ce4152a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "bd6b8ed84b90da467e8fbc812aba9f698ba9b9610d3f61cf3e8ff645eefccdbe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "430ce34b-dff8-449b-b66d-a1f26cc71e64", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "947065a77435825d3a8e13321bb8a036a103ed2e9c15974eee7b3d25002dac8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "He added that the patent was careful not to stipulate that the technology was designed for Internet applications.

The campaign was numbers and data driven. Wagner used big data in a hub composed of 54 statisticians, engineers, data scientists, and organizers from all over the world. Their numbers helped them drive every decision they made about TV, working in the field, raising money, and their communication strategy. They took big data from their disparate sources of data, and put it into one place to drive decision making, on TV, communication, fundraising, digital etc. His department's work was credited with \"reinventing how national campaigns are done\" and has been highlighted in Time, MIT Technology Review, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Los Angeles Times, and Harper's Magazine.\r\nEric Schmidt approached Wagner after the election regarding his algorithms and the two discussed options regarding Wagner's future and Wagner's desire to start a company that would keep together the analytics team they had built.  Wagner was simultaneously being approached by nonprofit organizations with big data and that wanted to make better decisions with their data. Schmidt then became an investor and adviser to Wagner.\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Chris Wiggins (data scientist)\r\nChris Wiggins is an associate professor of applied mathematics at Columbia University.

In 1997, he switched to Walkinshaw's Formula One team Arrows, working as Damon Hill's chief data engineer. In 1998, he stepped up to race engineering, working with drivers like Jos Verstappen.\r\n\r\nFerrari\r\nFor the 2001 season, Dyer moved to Ferrari, working as Schumacher's vehicle engineer, alongside Luca Baldisserri. By the end of 2002, Dyer engineered Schumacher at the tests; after the championship had been won, he also race engineered Schumacher at the last three races at Monza, Indianapolis, and Suzuka. Dyer then race engineered Schumacher to his 2003 and 2004 world titles, appearing with the German on the podium after his triumph at the 2003 Canadian Grand Prix. Dyer was quoted saying: \"One of Michael's strengths is that, apart from driving quickly, he has an understanding of the car and how all the systems work.\"\r\nDyer took over as R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen's race engineer when the Finn moved to Ferrari in 2007. Despite suggestions that the pair did not always get the most from the package, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen took the title in 2007 at the final race by a single point over Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso. After the disappointing results in the 2008 season, Ferrari announced that Dyer would be replaced by Andrea Stella for the 2009 season, with Dyer promoted to chief track engineer.\r\nOn 4 January 2011, Ferrari announced that Dyer was replaced as head of race track engineering by former McLaren engineer Pat Fry. This decision was taken after Dyer made the call to bring Alonso in the pit lane to cover off the Australian Mark Webber's pit stop in the final race of the season, the 2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Often described by media as a \"data alchemist\", he created the music discovery website Every Noise at Once, and is in part responsible for the naming of the hyperpop musical movement.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nMcDonald worked for a time at the music intelligence firm The Echo Nest. This company was acquired by Spotify in 2013, and the genre mapping data created by McDonald was built into various Spotify features, including its \"Daily Mix\" and \"Fans also like\" recommendation functions. He created the Every Noise at Once website that year. Under Spotify, he continued to work as part of a team to categorize tracks from about one million artists into 6,291 named genres, including 56 kinds of reggae, 202 kinds of folk and 230 kinds of hip hop. He developed an algorithm for the company which evaluated music based on what he called \"subjective psychoacoustic attributes\", including \"tempo,\" \"duration,\" \"color,\" \"modernity,\" and \"femininity.\" He then named what he called \"emerging genres\" himself, including the Spotify genre Escape Room, so named because of its sonic connection to trap music. In 2018, McDonald input the genre name \"hyperpop\" into this metadata, which was later used to name Spotify's hyperpop playlist and thus the musical movement itself.\r\nOn December 4, 2023, McDonald was one of the 1,500 employees, or 17% of its workforce, laid off by Spotify. As a result, he lost access to the data needed to maintain and update his website's database, as well as the ability to fix any errors caused by possible changes on Spotify's end. A spokesperson for Spotify stated that the current status of Every Noise was likely to remain for the foreseeable future.\r\nIn 2024, McDonald's book You Have Not Yet Heard Your Favourite Song, about the increasing reliance of the music industry upon streaming, was published. In the book, he describes Spotify as \"surveillance capitalism\" that makes use of name, age, gender, location and existing tastes, but is limited in its knowledge. Upon the release of the 2024 edition of Spotify Wrapped, he criticised its rollout, stating that \"the goal of Wrapped, in particular, is brand virality,\" and that \"there\u2019s not much in the way this year of data storytelling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n== References ==\r\n\r\nTitle: Luigi Mangione\r\nLuigi Nicholas Mangione (  loo-EE-jee MAN-jee-OH-nee; born May 6, 1998) is an American man who was identified as the suspect in the killing of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, which took place on December 4, 2024, in New York City.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 646236, "end_char_idx": 650437, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "224fc471-e278-4650-9779-8a4ae6a460a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "224fc471-e278-4650-9779-8a4ae6a460a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d43a69e-d437-446c-ad97-69b2df6477de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\GITHUB\\IC HACK\\IC-Hack-Project\\rag\\rag_template_main\\wikipedia_cs\\data\\example.txt.txt", "file_name": "example.txt.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 673848, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-02"}, "hash": "1c513931103fc4a2b13bda33c2f1027497ebf4cff759aa5fde3abe17b16cb714", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9dcd8f25-be55-4f8c-a4b9-3dbe0a4bb1c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ebecb614f708c14e06e016fc4ccee5169496702378920682788d94d00ac3621b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In the book, he describes Spotify as \"surveillance capitalism\" that makes use of name, age, gender, location and existing tastes, but is limited in its knowledge.

After waiving extradition in Pennsylvania, he appeared in a federal court in New York City. Mangione was arraigned in the New York Supreme Court and pleaded not guilty to his state charges. Mangione has been indicted on eleven state charges and faces four federal charges. These include first-degree murder, murder in furtherance of terrorism, criminal possession of a weapon, and stalking. The federal murder by firearm charge makes him eligible for the death penalty, although federal prosecutors have yet to indicate whether they will pursue it.\r\nSince his arrest, Mangione has received support online, with some celebrating him as a folk hero. Opinion polls found that a majority of American adult respondents held a negative view toward Mangione, with younger and left-leaning respondents more likely to support him. The support Mangione has generated has been connected to negative views of the health insurance industry and harmful claim denial practices. The case has spurred growing calls for health insurance reform.\r\n\r\nEarly life, education, and career\r\nMangione was born in Towson, Maryland, on May 6, 1998, to a Baltimore-area family of Italian descent. His paternal grandfather, Nicholas Mangione, was born to poor Sicilian immigrant parents in the Little Italy neighborhood of Baltimore; he had 10 children (five sons and five daughters) and 37 grandchildren, one of whom (a cousin of Luigi) is Nino Mangione, a member of the Maryland House of Delegates. After Nicholas Mangione's death, his children took over his businesses; Luigi's father now runs the Mangione Family Enterprises. The extended family also owns Hayfields Country Club, Turf Valley Resort, Lorien Health Services, the WCBM radio station, as well as the Mangione Family Foundation.\r\nMangione attended Gilman School, an all-boys private secondary school in Baltimore, where he graduated as valedictorian in 2016. Mangione received a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) in computer engineering and a Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) in computer and information science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020. His undergraduate studies included a minor in mathematics, and his graduate curriculum was concentrated in artificial intelligence. He was a UI programming intern with the video game company Firaxis Games from May 2016 to August 2017 while he was an undergraduate student.\r\nMangione began to work remotely in November 2020 as a data engineer for TrueCar, a car retailing website company headquartered in Santa Monica, California. His employment there ended at some point during 2023, according to the company. His last known residence was in Honolulu, Hawaii.\r\n\r\nAlleged role in the killing of Brian Thompson\r\nBackground\r\nBrian Thompson, CEO of the American health insurance company UnitedHealthcare, was shot and killed in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, on December 4, 2024. The shooting occurred early in the morning outside an entrance to the New York Hilton Midtown hotel. Thompson was in the city to attend an annual investors' meeting for UnitedHealthcare's parent company UnitedHealth Group. The suspect, initially described as a white man wearing a mask, fled the scene.\r\nThe gunman was masked and had come to New York via a bus from Atlanta. The words \"delay\", \"deny\", and \"depose\" were written on the spent cases and an ejected cartridge. The three words are similar to the phrase \"delay, deny, defend\", a well-known phrase in the insurance industry alluding to insurance companies' efforts to not pay out claims. The suspect possibly left the city, being seen at a bus terminal afterward.

Anger erupted on social media platforms at Thompson, UnitedHealth, and the health insurance system generally, with many praising the killing.\r\n\r\nArrest\r\nOn December 9, 2024, local police arrested Mangione at a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, responding to a call from an employee made in response to a customer who suspected similarities between Mangione's appearance and images of Thompson's alleged killer released by the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Altoona is about 280 miles (450 km) west of New York City. The police reported that he was \"visibly shaken\" when they asked him if he had recently visited New York City.\r\nUpon searching Mangione, police said they found a similar 3D-printed gun and 3D-printed suppressor to the weapons used in the shooting and a fake driver's license from New Jersey with the name \"Mark Rosario\", the same name used by the alleged shooter to check into a Manhattan hostel. Shell casings found at the crime scene reportedly matched the gun. The police also said that, when they arrested Mangione, they found a 262-word handwritten document partly about the American healthcare system, which was characterized as a manifesto by multiple media outlets. Mangione had no prior criminal record.\r\n\r\nState and federal charges\r\nMangione was charged in Blair County, Pennsylvania, with carrying a gun without a license, forgery, falsely identifying himself to the authorities, and possessing \"instruments of crime\" on December 9, 2024. He was arraigned at around 6 p.m. at Blair County Courthouse on firearms charges, questioned by the NYPD, and denied bail. As he was led into the courthouse, Mangione shouted to the gathered cameras: \"That's completely out of touch and is an insult to the intelligence of the American people and their lived experience.\"\r\nLater that day, Mangione was charged in Manhattan with second-degree murder, three counts of illegal weapons possession, and forgery and sent to the State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon, a close-security state correctional facility in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOn December 17, 2024, Mangione was indicted on eleven New York state charges by the Manhattan district attorney's office.\r\nMurder in the first degree (murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism as defined under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001)\r\nMurder in the second degree as a crime of terrorism (a crime of terrorism under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, in the form of murder)\r\nMurder in the second degree (murder as such \u2013 intentional killing)\r\nCriminal possession of a weapon in the second degree (possession of a loaded firearm with intent to use the same unlawfully against another)\r\nCriminal possession of a weapon in the second degree (unlicensed carrying of a loaded firearm)\r\nCriminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (possession of an \"assault weapon\" under the gun laws in New York)\r\nCriminal possession of a weapon in the third degree

U.S. Attorney's Office Southern District of New York concerning the unsealing of the Complaint charging Mangione, they state \"The charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\"\r\nOn December 23, Mangione was arraigned in the New York Supreme Court and pleaded not guilty to his state charges.\r\n\r\nDefense\r\nMangione's Pennsylvania attorney Thomas Dickey said that Mangione would plead not guilty to all the charges against him. Mangione hired Karen Friedman Agnifilo, former prosecutor at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and former legal analyst with CNN, as his New York case defense attorney on December 13. Ten days later, Mangione was flown to New York after waiving his right to an extradition hearing.\r\nOn December 13, the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe removed a fundraiser created by Mangione's supporters to cover his legal costs. The site's Terms of Service prohibits fundraisers for the legal defense of violent crimes, and it was removed; a GiveSendGo fundraiser has remained live, and, by December 24, 2024, it had raised more than US$200,000.\r\n\r\nPersonal life\r\nMangione wrote online that he suffers from spondylolisthesis and Lyme disease. He allegedly underwent a spinal fusion surgery in July 2023. Police stated that Mangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare.\r\nIn the summer of 2024, Mangione stopped posting on social media. On November 18, 2024, his mother reported him missing to the San Francisco Police Department, saying the family had not heard from him since July of that year, shortly after a trip to East and Southeast Asia. Mangione's mother contacted the San Francisco Police Department because she believed that Mangione lived in San Francisco and still worked for TrueCar, which had an office there.\r\n\r\nViews\r\nHandwritten letter\r\nUpon Mangione's arrest, police said they found in his possession a 262-word handwritten document, which many media outlets characterized as a \"manifesto\", that, according to NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch, spoke to Mangione's \"motivation and mindset\". Excerpts of the document included, \"I do apologize for any strife or trauma, but it had to be done\" and \"These parasites had it coming\". The document further expressed disdain for corporate greed and power. It also said that the U.S. had the most high-priced healthcare system in the world and corporate profits continued to rise while the life expectancy of Americans did not. The document also listed Michael Moore and Elisabeth Rosenthal as those who had \"illuminated the corruption and greed\" of the healthcare/health insurance industry, but noted that the \"problems simply remained.\"\r\nKen Klippenstein is the only journalist to publish what was alleged to be the entire document police said was found on Mangione. However, the Complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney's office states \"The Feds Letter also stated: 'P.S. you can check serial numbers to verify this is all self-funded.

His posts were found to express concerns over the implications of pornography, DEI programs, falling fertility rates, wokeism, secularization, and the decline of Christianity, and he promoted traditionalist ideas. He leans in favor of religion in general on evolutionary grounds, opposing New Atheism and has expressed interest in Japan's indigenous religion, Shintoism. Mangione showed a skeptical attitude toward both Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Multiple sources have reported that he followed Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as well as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others, labeling him as politically uncategorized and \"anti-system\".\r\nAccording to Business Insider, Mangione's since-deleted social media posts supported the idea that \"his worldview was influenced by reactionary right-wing thinkers\". Time magazine said it could not discern whether his political views were left- or right-wing. The Spectator wrote that his worldview \"wasn't pinned to a standard left-right axis\". Jacobin stated that he held \"a hodgepodge of views and political beliefs that don't neatly map onto any one category on the political spectrum\".\r\nMangione posted a Goodreads review of \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski's Industrial Society and Its Future, describing Kaczynski as \"rightfully imprisoned\" and criticizing his use of violence against innocent individuals. The review was quoted as writing, \"Clearly written by a mathematics prodigy. Reads like a series of lemmas on the question of 21st century quality of life\", and \"It's easy to quickly and thoughtless write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies [...] but it's simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.\" The review, which gave the manifesto four out of five stars, also contained a quote that the reviewer claimed to have found online. The quote contained the lines \"'Violence never solved anything' is a statement uttered by cowards and predators,\" and \"When all other forms of communication fail, violence is necessary to survive\".\r\nJournalist Robert Evans described Mangione as being associated with a loosely-defined online subculture called the \"gray tribe\" or the \"rationalist movement\", whose members he described as \"self-consciously intellectual and open-minded, [and] preoccupied with learning how to overcome their own mental biases. They're deliberately eclectic in their information diet, invoking esoteric ideas from many different fields, [and are] often systems thinkers, who take pride in attributing social problems not to individual evil but to complex interplays of incentives and institutions\".\r\n\r\nPublic image\r\nFollowing the Thompson shooting, the suspected shooter was celebrated as a folk hero by many social media users. Look-alike contests have been held in New York City's Washington Square Park and at the University of Florida.\r\nAfter Mangione's arrest, he received support and praise on social media and over 460,000 followers after his identification on Twitter. According to the Network Contagion Research Institute, variations of \"#FreeLuigi\" have been shared over 50,000 times on Twitter after his arrest. The Altoona McDonald's where Mangione was identified by an employee and subsequently arrested was flooded with negative reviews (known as \"review bombing\"), many describing the restaurant as having rats. Groups of people gathered outside the Blair County Courthouse and Manhattan Criminal Court to show their support for Mangione during his December court hearings. The support Mangione has generated has been connected to the public's often negative view of the health insurance industry and what many consider to be unfair claim denial practices that inflict harm. The case has spurred growing calls for health insurance reform. A December 2024 NORC at the University of Chicago poll found that a majority of American adults believe that health insurance company denials for health care coverage and/or profits made by those companies share a moderate amount or a great deal of responsibility for Thompson's death.\r\n\r\nStreet art, graffiti, and signs in support of Mangione appeared on buildings, streets, highways, and other places.

A billboard with the words \"Free Luigi\" was seen in Riverside County, California, and a mural portraying Mangione as the Nintendo character Luigi was seen in Seattle. Images and memes of Mangione depicted as a Roman Catholic saint have circulated online. Items and merchandise in support of Mangione were posted on Etsy, Amazon, and other e-commerce sites before being removed. Some merchandise were reportedly the subject of copyright and DMCA takedown requests from an entity purporting to be UnitedHealth Group Inc. Other social media users linked Mangione's jail commissary account soliciting donations for \"snacks, sodas, an iPad, etc.\" The Independent reported that, during his time in custody in Pennsylvania, Mangione had received over 100 pieces of mail.\r\nMangione has been noted for his perceived physical attractiveness, and Kara Alaimo, writing for Time, stated that he has become \"somewhat of an online sex symbol\". After Mangione's Manhattan courtroom appearance on December 23, Maison Margiela trended on Twitter and Threads after social media users misidentified the brand of the burgundy sweater that Mangione was wearing. Users later determined that he was wearing a \"washable Merino crewneck sweater\" from Nordstrom, which social media users nicknamed 'Mangione Merino', quickly selling out. A criminal justice professor, speaking about Mangione's online popularity, told Women's Wear Daily that \"What we see with Mangione is he has quickly become a folk hero and a fashion folk hero.\"\r\n\r\nPerp walk\r\nAfter being transported from Pennsylvania to New York on December 19, Mangione received a highly publicized perp walk, escorted by a large number of heavily armed law enforcement officials and Mayor of New York City Eric Adams. Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg said that \"The FBI and NYDA could have transported Mangione discreetly, but they opted for a public show,\" and some legal experts stated that the perp walk was a \"blatant and unnecessary attempt at self-promotion.\" Policy director for the Justice Collaboratory at Yale Law School Jorge Camacho said that, \"In a case like Mangione's, where the suspect has garnered some sympathy and applause from people frustrated with greedy health-care insurance companies, the tactic can backfire\".\r\nSome social media users shared memes and compared Mangione's perp walk to the arrest of Jesus, scenes from the Superman movies, and Renaissance paintings. On December 23 during Mangione's New York court hearing where he pled not guilty to the state charges, his defense attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo said that Mangione might not receive a fair trial due to publicity from law enforcement presentations of him, blaming Mayor of New York City Eric Adams for the \"unnecessary\" and \"utterly political\" perp walk. She added, \"The mayor should know more than anyone about the presumption of innocence,\" suggesting Adams was attempting to distract from the charges he himself is facing.\r\n\r\nOpinion polls\r\nAn Economist/YouGov poll conducted from December 15 to 17 surveying 1,553 U.S. adult citizens found that 43% of American citizens had a \"somewhat unfavorable\" or \"very unfavorable\" view of Mangione, while 21% had a \"somewhat favorable\" or \"very favorable\" view of him. 37% were unsure. Mangione received the most support from citizens aged 18\u201329, who viewed him favorably by a 39%\u201329% margin, and very liberal citizens, who viewed him favorably by a 47%\u201331% margin.

Mangione was viewed least favorably by citizens aged 65 and older (65%\u20135% unfavorable) and very conservative citizens (62%\u20138% unfavorable).\r\nThe Center for Strategic Politics ran an online poll with 455 American adults on December 11 and found that \"61% of respondents said they have a strong or somewhat negative perception of Mangione\", 19% had a positive or somewhat positive view, and 21% did not know. Opinions on Mangione vary \"dramatically\" by age, with respondents under 45 holding a more positive view of him than those over 45. Additionally, they indicated that men were more likely to support Mangione than women, and Black and Hispanic respondents were more likely to support him than White respondents. The poll also found that young Americans view Mangione \"far more favorably\" than they viewed Thompson and UnitedHealthcare.\r\nA poll of 6,000 U.S. adults was conducted by CloudResearch on December 19, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI). The poll found that roughly one in four respondents were sympathetic to Mangione.\r\n\r\nIn popular culture\r\nMangione was referenced in various season 50 sketches of the American sketch comedy late-night television series Saturday Night Live. He was mentioned in the Weekend Update segments with anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che; in his opening monologue, comedian Chris Rock joked about the capture of Mangione; in another sketch, Nancy Grace (played by Sarah Sherman) expressed disbelief at the online support of Mangione and interviews a regular Pennsylvania McDonald's customer (played by Kenan Thompson) and an alleged Mangione look-alike (played by Emil Wakim).\r\nPopularity and admiration of Mangione online brought a revival of the former internet meme \"Luigi Death Stare\" among comments replying to online posts concerning the development of an American oligarchy.\r\nVulture reported that documentaries about Mangione are in development. One documentary is being developed by Alex Gibney and Anonymous Content, and the other by Stephen Robert Morse. ABC News released their documentary titled Manhunt: Luigi Mangione and the CEO Murder - A Special Edition of 20/20 on December 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nReferences\r\nExternal links\r\n\r\nCommonwealth v.
