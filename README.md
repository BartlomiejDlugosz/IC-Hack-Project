# **Hobby Bridge** 
**an IC-Hack-Project**

Have you ever wanted to learn more about computer science but the content too dry and abstract?

Are you amazingly good at some other, unrelated topic?

Have you ever wished that data science sounded more like football, fishing, cooking or any other reasonable topic?

If you answered yes to all, any, or none of those questions, it is time to bridge the gap between computer science and your hobby via the ***Hobby Bridge***.

## Unique learning environment 

Hobby bridge allows you to learn complex computer science topics with the assured knowledge and comfort of your favorite hobby.

It is the only adult-aimed computer science learning tool that aims to make such education pleasurable rather than tedious. God knows, you already have enough on your plate and the last thing you need after a long day of work is a bland curriculum either uses boring abstractions or was created for children.

Get started anywhere with our user-friendly website.
Just tell us a bit about yourself and start going.
