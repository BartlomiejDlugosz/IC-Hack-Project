The support Mangione has generated has been connected to the public\\'s often negative view of the health insurance industry and what many consider to be unfair claim denial practices that inflict harm. The case has spurred growing calls for health insurance reform. A December 2024 NORC at the University of Chicago poll found that a majority of American adults believe that health insurance company denials for health care coverage and/or profits made by those companies share a moderate amount or a great deal of responsibility for Thompson\\'s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nStreet art, graffiti, and signs in support of Mangione appeared on buildings, streets, highways, and other places. A billboard with the words \"Free Luigi\" was seen in Riverside County, California, and a mural portraying Mangione as the Nintendo character Luigi was seen in Seattle. Images and memes of Mangione depicted as a Roman Catholic saint have circulated online. Items and merchandise in support of Mangione were posted on Etsy, Amazon, and other e-commerce sites before being removed. Some merchandise were reportedly the subject of copyright and DMCA takedown requests from an entity purporting to be UnitedHealth Group Inc. Other social media users linked Mangione\\'s jail commissary account soliciting donations for \"snacks, sodas, an iPad, etc.\" The Independent reported that, during his time in custody in Pennsylvania, Mangione had received over 100 pieces of mail.\\r\\nMangione has been noted for his perceived physical attractiveness, and Kara Alaimo, writing for Time, stated that he has become \"somewhat of an online sex symbol\". After Mangione\\'s Manhattan courtroom appearance on December 23, Maison Margiela trended on Twitter and Threads after social media users misidentified the brand of the burgundy sweater that Mangione was wearing. Users later determined that he was wearing a \"washable Merino crewneck sweater\" from Nordstrom, which social media users nicknamed \\'Mangione Merino\\', quickly selling out. A criminal justice professor, speaking about Mangione\\'s online popularity, told Women\\'s Wear Daily that \"What we see with Mangione is he has quickly become a folk hero and a fashion folk hero.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPerp walk\\r\\nAfter being transported from Pennsylvania to New York on December 19, Mangione received a highly publicized perp walk, escorted by a large number of heavily armed law enforcement officials and Mayor of New York City Eric Adams. Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg said that \"The FBI and NYDA could have transported Mangione discreetly, but they opted for a public show,\" and some legal experts stated that the perp walk was a \"blatant and unnecessary attempt at self-promotion.\" Policy director for the Justice Collaboratory at Yale Law School Jorge Camacho said that, \"In a case like Mangione\\'s, where the suspect has garnered some sympathy and applause from people frustrated with greedy health-care insurance companies, the tactic can backfire\".\\r\\nSome social media users shared memes and compared Mangione\\'s perp walk to the arrest of Jesus, scenes from the Superman movies, and Renaissance paintings. On December 23 during Mangione\\'s New York court hearing where he pled not guilty to the state charges, his defense attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo said that Mangione might not receive a fair trial due to publicity from law enforcement presentations of him, blaming Mayor of New York City Eric Adams for the \"unnecessary\" and \"utterly political\" perp walk. She added, \"The mayor should know more than anyone about the presumption of innocence,\" suggesting Adams was attempting to distract from the charges he himself is facing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpinion polls\\r\\nAn Economist/YouGov poll conducted from December 15 to 17 surveying 1,553 U.S. adult citizens found that 43% of American citizens had a \"somewhat unfavorable\" or \"very unfavorable\" view of Mangione, while 21% had a \"somewhat favorable\" or \"very favorable\" view of him. 37% were unsure. Mangione received the most support from citizens aged 18–29, who viewed him favorably by a 39%–29% margin, and very liberal citizens, who viewed him favorably by a 47%–31% margin. Mangione was viewed least favorably by citizens aged 65 and older (65%–5% unfavorable) and very conservative citizens (62%–8% unfavorable).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=664796, end_char_idx=669212, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.0601851288273527), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='9d43a69e-d437-446c-ad97-69b2df6477de', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'c:\\\\GITHUB\\\\IC HACK\\\\IC-Hack-Project\\\\rag\\\\rag_template_main\\\\wikipedia_cs\\\\data\\\\example.txt.txt', 'file_name': 'example.txt.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 673848, 'creation_date': '2025-02-02', 'last_modified_date': '2025-02-02'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c753368f-6bdf-4310-863d-b45fb30f30a5', node_type='4', metadata={'file_path': 'c:\\\\GITHUB\\\\IC HACK\\\\IC-Hack-Project\\\\rag\\\\rag_template_main\\\\wikipedia_cs\\\\data\\\\example.txt.txt', 'file_name': 'example.txt.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 673848, 'creation_date': '2025-02-02', 'last_modified_date': '2025-02-02'}, hash='11add01adf9f51db2c03e4162ae3239baf772ba2a09cdeca5bb93f4e3d072d29'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='430ce34b-dff8-449b-b66d-a1f26cc71e64', node_type='1', metadata={'file_path': 'c:\\\\GITHUB\\\\IC HACK\\\\IC-Hack-Project\\\\rag\\\\rag_template_main\\\\wikipedia_cs\\\\data\\\\example.txt.txt', 'file_name': 'example.txt.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 673848, 'creation_date': '2025-02-02', 'last_modified_date': '2025-02-02'}, hash='4b157bacee8f19e99e7fa5d8c8f0143e995096e3bdcd170154eb7401224d86ca'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='224fc471-e278-4650-9779-8a4ae6a460a9', node_type='1', metadata={}, hash='ef4a35caeb62d05361200a35dc5e3fb87ee764abfb3ea1fa5c93fb79e6e8ed3a')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='Despite suggestions that the pair did not always get the most from the package, Räikkönen took the title in 2007 at the final race by a single point over Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso.

Often described by media as a \"data alchemist\", he created the music discovery website Every Noise at Once, and is in part responsible for the naming of the hyperpop musical movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nMcDonald worked for a time at the music intelligence firm The Echo Nest. This company was acquired by Spotify in 2013, and the genre mapping data created by McDonald was built into various Spotify features, including its \"Daily Mix\" and \"Fans also like\" recommendation functions. He created the Every Noise at Once website that year. Under Spotify, he continued to work as part of a team to categorize tracks from about one million artists into 6,291 named genres, including 56 kinds of reggae, 202 kinds of folk and 230 kinds of hip hop. He developed an algorithm for the company which evaluated music based on what he called \"subjective psychoacoustic attributes\", including \"tempo,\" \"duration,\" \"color,\" \"modernity,\" and \"femininity.\" He then named what he called \"emerging genres\" himself, including the Spotify genre Escape Room, so named because of its sonic connection to trap music. In 2018, McDonald input the genre name \"hyperpop\" into this metadata, which was later used to name Spotify\\'s hyperpop playlist and thus the musical movement itself.\\r\\nOn December 4, 2023, McDonald was one of the 1,500 employees, or 17% of its workforce, laid off by Spotify. As a result, he lost access to the data needed to maintain and update his website\\'s database, as well as the ability to fix any errors caused by possible changes on Spotify\\'s end. A spokesperson for Spotify stated that the current status of Every Noise was likely to remain for the foreseeable future.\\r\\nIn 2024, McDonald\\'s book You Have Not Yet Heard Your Favourite Song, about the increasing reliance of the music industry upon streaming, was published. In the book, he describes Spotify as \"surveillance capitalism\" that makes use of name, age, gender, location and existing tastes, but is limited in its knowledge. Upon the release of the 2024 edition of Spotify Wrapped, he criticised its rollout, stating that \"the goal of Wrapped, in particular, is brand virality,\" and that \"there’s not much in the way this year of data storytelling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==\\r\\n\\r\\nTitle: Luigi Mangione\\r\\nLuigi Nicholas Mangione (  loo-EE-jee MAN-jee-OH-nee; born May 6, 1998) is an American man who was identified as the suspect in the killing of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, which took place on December 4, 2024, in New York City.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=646236, end_char_idx=650437, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.05901005044755582)], metadata={'58564d07-f7d7-47fc-a662-90571ce0f31e': {'file_path': 'c:\\\\GITHUB\\\\IC HACK\\\\IC-Hack-Project\\\\rag\\\\rag_template_main\\\\wikipedia_cs\\\\data\\\\example.txt.txt', 'file_name': 'example.txt.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 673848, 'creation_date': '2025-02-02', 'last_modified_date': '2025-02-02'}, '9d43a69e-d437-446c-ad97-69b2df6477de': {'file_path': 'c:\\\\GITHUB\\\\IC HACK\\\\IC-Hack-Project\\\\rag\\\\rag_template_main\\\\wikipedia_cs\\\\data\\\\example.txt.txt', 'file_name': 'example.txt.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 673848, 'creation_date': '2025-02-02', 'last_modified_date': '2025-02-02'}})"
